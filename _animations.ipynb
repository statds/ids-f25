    "### What is Data Animation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Animation is the process of showing change over time through a continously updating plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is commonly used to visualize progress, simulations, or changing datasets, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Simulations like rolling dice.\n",
    "    - A scatterplot which updates with new data.\n",
    "    - A line chart that grows over time, like exponential graphs.\n",

    "### Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Created in 2008 by John D. Hunter, Matplotlib is one of Python's most used library for plotting and visualization. You are able to create line, scatter, bar, and histogram plots. You can customize colors, labels, and configure layouts. For this section, we can use Matplotlib's advanced modules like animations to make more dynamic visualizations.\n",

    "The specific tool we are focused on is `matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation`, it is used to update our plot frame-by-frame.\n",

    "To use `FuncAnimation`, you first will need to install `Matplotlib`. Inside your terminal, use the corresponding manager you currently use."
