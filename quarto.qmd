# Reproducible Data Science {#sec-quarto}

Data science projects should be reproducible to be trustworthy. Dynamic
documents facilitate reproducibility. [Quarto](https://quarto.org) is an
open-source dynamic document preparation system, ideal for scientific and
technical publishing. From the official websites, Quarto can be used to:

+ Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.
+ Author documents as plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks.
+ Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and
  books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
+ Author with scientific markdown, including equations, citations,
  cross references, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.
  

## Introduction to Quarto

To get started with Quarto, see documentation at
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).


For a clean style, I suggest that you use
`VS Code` as your IDE. The `ipynb` files have extra
formats in plain texts, which are not as clean as
`qmd` files. There are, of course, tools to convert between
the two representations of a notebook. For example:


```
quarto convert hello.ipynb # converts to qmd
quarto convert hello.qmd   # converts to ipynb
```


We will use Quarto for homework assignments, classnotes, and presentations.
You will see them in action through in-class demonstrations.
The following sections in the [Quarto Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)
are immediately useful.

+ [Markdown basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)
+ [Using Python](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html)
+ [Presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/)


A template for homework is in this repo (`hwtemp.qmd`) to get you
started with homework assignments.


## Compiling the Classnotes {#sec-buildnotes}

The sources of the classnotes are at <https://github.com/statds/ids-s25>.
This is also the source tree that you will contributed to this semester.
I expect that you clone the repository to your own computer, update it
frequently, and compile the latest version on your computer (reproducibility).


To compile the classnotes, you need the following tools:
Git, Quarto, and Python.


### Set up your Python Virtual Environment

I suggest that a Python virtual environment for the classnotes
be set up in the current directory for reproducibility.
A Python virtual environment is simply a directory with a particular
file structure, which contains a specific Python interpreter and
software libraries and binaries needed to support a project. It
allows us to isolate our Python development projects from our system
installed Python and other Python environments.

To create a Python virtual environment for our classnotes:
```
python3 -m venv .ids-s25-venv
```

Here `.ids-s25-venv` is the name of the virtual environment 
to be created. Choose an informative name. This only needs to
be set up once.


To activate this virtual environment:

```
. .ids-s25-venv/bin/activate
```

After activating the virtual environment, you will see
`(.ids-s25-venv)` at the beginning of your shell prompt.
Then, the Python interpreter and packages needed will be
the local versions in this virtual environment without
interfering your system-wide installation or other virtual
environments.


To install the Python packages that are needed to compile
the classnotes, we have a `requirements.txt` file that specifies
the packages and their versions. They can be installed
easily with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are interested in learning how to create the
`requirements.txt` file, just put your question into a Google search.


To exit the virtual environment, simply type `deactivate`
in your command line. This will return you to your system’s
global Python environment.


### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your own computer. In a terminal (command line),
go to an appropriate directory (folder), and clone the repo. For example,
if you use `ssh` for authentication: 

```
git clone git@github.com:statds/ids-s25.git
```

### Render the Classnotes

Assuming `quarto` has been set up, we render 
the classnotes in the cloned repository

```
cd ids-s25
quarto render
```

If there are error messages, search and find solutions to clear
them. Otherwise, the html version of the notes will be available under
`_book/index.html`, which is default location of the output.


### Login Requirements

For some illustrations, you need to interact with certain sites that
require account information. For example, for Google map services,
you need to save your API key in a file named `api_key.txt` in the
root folder of the source. Another example is to access the US Census
API, where you would need to register an account and get your Census
API Key.


## The Data Science Life Cycle

This section summarizes Chapter 2 of *Veridical Data Science*
\citep{yu2024veridical}, which introduces the data science life cycle
(DSLC). The DSLC provides a structured way to think about the
progression of data science projects. It consists of six stages, each with
a distinct purpose:

- Stage 1: Problem formulation and data collection  
  Collaborate with domain experts to refine vague questions into ones
  that can realistically be answered with data. Identify what data already
  exists or design new collection protocols. Understanding the
  collection process is crucial for assessing how data relates to reality.

- Stage 2: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis  
  Clean data to make it tidy, unambiguous, and correctly formatted.
  Preprocess it to meet the requirements of specific algorithms, such as
  handling missing values or scaling variables. Exploratory data analysis
  (EDA) summarizes patterns using tables, statistics, and plots, while
  explanatory data analysis polishes visuals for communication.

- Stage 3: Exploring intrinsic data structures (optional)  
  Techniques such as dimensionality reduction simplify data into
  lower-dimensional forms, while clustering identifies natural groupings
  among observations. Even if not central to the project, these methods
  often enhance understanding.

- Stage 4: Predictive and/or inferential analysis (optional)  
  Many projects are cast as prediction tasks, training algorithms like
  regression or random forests to forecast outcomes. Inference focuses
  on estimating population parameters and quantifying uncertainty.
  This book emphasizes prediction while acknowledging inference as
  important in many domains.

- Stage 5: Evaluation of results  
  Findings should be evaluated both qualitatively, through critical
  thinking, and quantitatively, through the PCS framework. PCS stands
  for predictability, computability, and stability:  
  * Predictability asks whether findings hold up in relevant future data.  
  * Computability asks whether methods are feasible with available
    computational resources.  
  * Stability asks whether conclusions remain consistent under
    reasonable changes in data, methods, or judgment calls.  
  Together, PCS provides a foundation for assessing the reliability of
  data-driven results.

- Stage 6: Communication of results  
  Results must be conveyed clearly to intended audiences, whether
  through reports, presentations, visualizations, or deployable tools.
  Communication should be tailored so findings can inform real-world
  decisions.

The DSLC is not a linear pipeline---analysts often loop back to refine
earlier steps. The chapter also cautions against data snooping, where
patterns discovered during exploration are mistaken for reliable truths.
Applying PCS ensures that results are not only technically sound but
also trustworthy and interpretable across the life cycle.
