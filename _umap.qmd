### Introduction

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was introduced by 
Leland McInnes, John Healy, and James Melville in 2018
[@mcinnes2020umapuniformmanifoldapproximation]. UMAP is a powerful 
dimensionality reduction technique designed to visualize high-dimensional 
data in a low-dimensional space, such as 2D or 3D. Unlike linear methods
like PCA, UMAP captures nonlinear structures, preserving local clusters 
while also maintaining the overall global patterns of the data. UMAP is 
utilized forclustering, data visualization, and data exploration.


### Other Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

#### Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
- linear technique; projects data along directions of maximum variance
- Preserves global structure fairly well but may lose local neighborhood 
  details.
- good for visualization of 2-3 PCs but cannot capture nonlinear
  structures.


#### t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- finds distances between pairs of points, maps onto t dist.
- nonlinear technique; preserves local structure very well.
- can distort global relationships
- often slower than UMAP for large datasets

### Algorithm Approach and Intuition
UMAP is a graph-based dimensionality reduction algorithm rooted in algebraic
topology. It represents data as a fuzzy graph and finds a low-dimensional
embedding that preserves both local neighborhoods and global structure.

#### Mathematical Foundations

1. Riemannian Manifold
UMAP assumes the data lies on a Riemannian manifold, 
a smoothly curved surface embedded in high-dimensional space.

1. Simplicial Sets
From algebraic topology, a simplex is the simplest geometric building 
block (a point, line, triangle, etc.), and a simplicial complex describes
how these pieces connect to form a space. Geometrically a k-simplex is a 
very simple way to build a k-dimensional object.

#### Visualizing the manifold
UMAP builds a graph as a discrete approximation of the manifold’s structure.
First, lets visualize a topological representation of some data.
```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(42)

# 50 points along sin wave
x = np.sort(np.random.rand(50) * 13)

y = np.sin(x)
# generate random numbers from normal dist
noise = 0.05 * np.random.randn(len(x))
y = y + noise

plt.scatter(x, y, color='blue')

plt.axis('off')
```

#### Learning the manifold structure
1. Finding nearest neighbors
For each point we find the nearest neighbors. This hyperparameter controls
how local or global we want our structure to be. A large amount of neighbors
represent the manifold more accurately as a whole and a smaller number would
capture fine details of the structure.

1. Constructing a neighborhood graph



#### Finding a low-dimensional representation
1. Minimum Distance


2. Minimizing the cost function (Cross-Entropy)
