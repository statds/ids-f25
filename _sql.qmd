## Database operation with Structured query language (SQL)

This section was prepared by Lewis Milun.

### Introduction
Structured Query Language (SQL) is one of the standard languages that is used 
to work with large databases. It uses tables to store and display data, 
creating an organized and comprehendable interface that makes it far easier to track and view your data.

Some advantages of using SQL include its ability to handle large amounts of data
while simultaneously simplifying the process of screating, updating, and 
retrieving any data you may want.

The biggest advantage of using SQL for the purposes of this class, is that it
can very easily connect with python and R. This makes it so that we can have
all of the benefits of working with SQL while still working in the python
environment we already have set up.

### Setting up Databases
In this section, we will be working with two databases, one that's built into
a python package (nycflights13) and one that we used for our midterm project 
(311 Service Requests)

#### nycflights13
This database is built into the pandas package and includes flight data for all
flights that left New York City airports in 2013. The database includes several
tables including ones that detail each flight, airline, airport, and much more
info regarding the flights. The data in this database is contained across 
several tables. Data stored like this would typically be irritating to deal with
however it is proven simple when working with SQL.

To set up this database, we need to import the proper packages:
```{python}
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
from nycflights13 import flights, airlines, airports
```

Here we imported "sqlite3" which is the package to import when working with SQL.
We also imported "pandas" which also includes the nycflights13 database and from
there imported the three tables we will be working with.

Now, we want to establish the connection between python and our sql database:
```{python}
nycconn = sqlite3.connect("nycflights13.db")
```

This snippet both creates the nycflights13.db database and establishes nycconn as
our connection to this database.

Next step is to add the three tables we imported from nycflights13 to the 
database:
```{python}
flights.to_sql("flights", nycconn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
airlines.to_sql("airlines", nycconn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
airports.to_sql("airports", nycconn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
```

What this does is converts the three pandas dataframes into tables in the sql
database. The if_exists argument handles what would happen if there is already
a table in the database with the same name. The index argument is determining whether or not the first column of the dataframe should be handled as the 
index of the table in the dataframe.
