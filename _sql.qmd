## Database operation with Structured query language (SQL)

This section was prepared by Lewis Milun.

### Introduction
Structured Query Language (SQL) is one of the standard languages that is used 
to work with large databases. It uses tables to store and display data, 
creating an organized and comprehendable interface that makes it far easier to
track and view your data.

Some advantages of using SQL include its ability to handle large amounts of data
while simultaneously simplifying the process of screating, updating, and 
retrieving any data you may want.

The biggest advantage of using SQL for the purposes of this class, is that it
can very easily connect with python and R. This makes it so that we can have
all of the benefits of working with SQL while still working in the python
environment we already have set up.

### Setting up Databases
In this section, we will be working with two databases, one that's built into
a python package (nycflights13) and one that we used for our midterm project 
(311 Service Requests)

#### nycflights13
This database is built into the pandas package and includes flight data for all
flights that left New York City airports in 2013. The database includes several
tables including ones that detail each flight, airline, airport, and much more
info regarding the flights. The data in this database is contained across 
several tables. Data stored like this would typically be irritating to deal with
however it is proven simple when working with SQL.

To set up this database, we need to import the proper packages:
```{python}
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
from nycflights13 import flights, airlines, airports
```

Here we imported "sqlite3" which is the package to import when working with SQL.
We also imported "pandas" which also includes the nycflights13 database and from
there imported the three tables we will be working with.

Now, we want to establish the connection between python and our sql database:
```{python}
nycconn = sqlite3.connect("nycflights13.db")
```

This snippet both creates the nycflights13.db database and establishes nycconn as
our connection to this database.

Next step is to add the three tables we imported from nycflights13 to the 
database:
```{python}
flights.to_sql("flights", nycconn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
airlines.to_sql("airlines", nycconn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
airports.to_sql("airports", nycconn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
```

What this does is converts the three pandas dataframes into tables in the sql
database. The if_exists argument handles what would happen if there is already
a table in the database with the same name. The index argument is determining
whether or not the first column of the dataframe should be handled as the 
index of the table in the dataframe.

#### serviceRequests Database
First, we need to import our serviceRequests data from the csv in the data
folder:
```{python}
df = pd.read_csv("data/serviceRequests06-09-2025_07-05-2025.csv")
```

Now we need to repeat the process from nycflights13 but for our serviceRequests:
```{python}
srconn = sqlite3.connect("serviceRequests.db")

df.to_sql("requests", srconn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
```

Here we imported the dataframe we got from the csv file as the only table in the
serviceRequests.db database.

### Query Basics
Now we can move onto working with the data in our SQL databases. The most common
use for SQL is writing a "query" which is a statement sent to the SQL databse
that returns a selection of rows and columns from the tables in a database.

We will be looking at the "flights" table in our nycflights13 database for this
seciton.

#### SELECT and FROM
The following is the most basic possible query one can perform:
```{python}
query = """
SELECT *
FROM flights;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

This snippet represents the basic form of writing SQL queries in python. We
create a variable 'query' that contains the statement we intend to pass into 
SQL. The last line then uses the nycconn connection we created earlier to pass
our query into SQL and it returns the head() of the result we get back.

This query is the most basic query, as it returns the entire flights table. The
SELECT line of the query is where you put the names of which columns you want 
from your table. You specify which table you want to work with on the FROM line.
We put "*" in our SELECT line which returns all columns.
All SQL queries must end with ";", otherwise you'll get an error.

Now let's try to simplify what we're seeing by only looking at the origins and
destinations of the flights:
```{python}
query = """
SELECT origin, dest
FROM flights;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

Here we replaced the "*" in our SELECT statement with "origin, dest"
This told SQL to only return those two columns from the database.

#### ORDER BY
These columns are quite messy to look at so let's try sorting them by origin:
```{python}
query = """
SELECT origin, dest
FROM flights
ORDER BY origin;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

Here we added a new "SORTBY" line. This line tells SQL what columns to sort 
the list by.

You can sort by multiple columns just by listing them with commas in between:
```{python}
query = """
SELECT origin, dest
FROM flights
ORDER BY origin, dest;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

#### SELECT DISTINCT
Now that the list is properly sorted, we can see that there are multiple flights
from each origin to destination combination. If we want to only see the unique
columns, we can do this:
```{python}
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT origin, dest
FROM flights
ORDER BY origin, dest;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

Here we replaced out "SELECT" statement with a "SELECT DISTINCT" statement. This
tells SQL to only return the unique columns from the query.

### Conditionals
Usually you wouldn't want to just return all rows or all unique rows from a table
You instead will have conditions that determine which rows are relevant to your
query

#### WHERE
The way you can add conditionals to your query is by adding a "WHERE" line.
Let's take the same list from the last section and filter it so that only the
flights that departed from LGA are returned:
```{python}
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT origin, dest
FROM flights
WHERE origin = 'LGA'
ORDER BY origin, dest;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

You add conditionals in the "WHERE" line by using the following comparators:
 + =
 + <
 + >
 + <=
 + >=
 + !=

Be careful of the type of the data in a particular column!

#### AND, OR, and NOT
You can add multiple conditionals by using AND, OR, and parenthesis
```{python}
query = """
SELECT origin, dest
FROM flights
WHERE origin = 'LGA' AND dest = 'ATL'
ORDER BY origin, dest;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

This uses AND to return all flights that departed from LGA and arrived in ATL

We can also use OR to return all flights that either departed from LGA or 
arrived in ATL:
```{python}
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT origin, dest
FROM flights
WHERE origin = 'LGA' OR dest = 'ATL'
ORDER BY origin, dest;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

When you want to get more complicated with your conditionals, parenthesis can
be used to ensure SQL is correctly mixing the AND and OR statements.

Use NOT to return the opposite of a statement:
```{python}
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT origin, dest
FROM flights
WHERE NOT (origin = 'LGA' OR dest = 'ATL')
ORDER BY origin, dest;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

#### COUNT
An easy way in SQL to see the total number of rows that fit the conditions you've specified:
```{python}
query = """
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dest)
FROM flights
WHERE NOT (origin = 'LGA' OR dest = 'ATL')
ORDER BY origin, dest;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

This returns the number of distinct destinations that fit the specified criteria

#### LIMIT
If you don't want to use .head() to only display the first few rows, this can be
done in SQL using a LIMIT statement:
```{python}
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT carrier, origin, dest
FROM flights
WHERE carrier = 'UA'
ORDER BY origin, dest
LIMIT 5;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn)
```

This query added the "carrier" column that displays the airline that held the flight. We specified that we want all flights from the "UA" airline and limited
the result to 5 rows.

An interesting thing you can do with conditionals in SQL is to filter by values
in a column that you are not displaying:
```{python}
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT origin, dest
FROM flights
WHERE carrier = 'UA'
ORDER BY origin, dest
LIMIT 5;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn)
```

Here we still filter by flights from the "UA" airline but we don't display the
column as that would be very redundant.

### Joins
The last query that we did was useful, however it isn't realistic to expect
users to memorize the two digit codes for all airlines. Thankfully, there is the
airlines table in our nycflights13.db database. Let's take a look at it:
```{python} 
query = """
SELECT *
FROM airlines;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

This table is much simpler than the "flights" table as it only has two columns.

#### INNER JOIN
Logically, we wouldn't want our outputted table to display the two digit code 
that represents each airline but instead we'd want to see the name of the 
airline. Thankfully, SQL has a way to join the data from the two tables 
together:
```{python}
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT a.name AS airline_name, f.origin, f.dest
FROM flights AS f
INNER JOIN airlines AS a
ON f.carrier = a.carrier;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

This is a much more complicated query that returns a table of the distinct
airline, origin, and destinations in the flights database. We introduced three
new statements in this query:
 + AS is similar to how "as" is used when importing packages in python. It
 gives us an opportunity to use a shorthand instead of needing to type out the
 full table names every time we mention a column. It can also be used in our 
 SELECT line to name columns in our resultant table
 + INNER JOIN connects a new table to our query (in this case, the new table is
 airlines).
 + ON lets SQL know what column in each table it should use to connect the 
 tables. Here we told SQL that in every row, when it reaches the carrier column
 in flights, it should use that as its reference for what row in airlines to use
 for values in this row. For example, in the first row, SQL saw that the carrier name in flights was "UA". SQL then looked in the carrier column in airlines and
 found the row in which "UA" was the value in that table's carrier column. So 
 when SQL was calculating the value for airline_name in the first row, it knew 
 which column to search in airline to find "United Air Lines Inc."

JOIN statements are key when using SQL to display data. This is what allows SQL
databases to be in such nice and concise forms.

Now let's also add in the values from the "airports" table so that we get the full names of the airports instead of their three digit codes:
```{python}
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT a.name AS airline_name,
       orig.name AS origin_name,
       dest.name AS dest_name
FROM flights AS f
INNER JOIN airlines AS a
    ON f.carrier = a.carrier
INNER JOIN airports AS orig
    ON f.origin = orig.faa
INNER JOIN airports AS dest
    ON f.dest = dest.faa;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

Here we use three different INNER JOIN statements to connect the two tables
properly. The reason we use two JOIN statements to connect the same "airports"
table is to have SQL be able to look separately for the origin and destination
airport names. This query also utilizes indenting to make the query far more
readable.

#### The difference between the three JOINs
SQL has three different versions of JOIN statements:
 + INNER JOIN
 + LEFT JOIN
 + RIGHT JOIN

This allows the user to determine what rows get included as a result of joining
two tables. Let's take a look at the differences:
##### INNER JOIN
```{python}
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT f.flight,
       a.name AS airline_name,
       orig.name AS origin_name,
       dest.name AS dest_name
FROM flights AS f
INNER JOIN airlines AS a
    ON f.carrier = a.carrier
INNER JOIN airports AS orig
    ON f.origin = orig.faa
INNER JOIN airports AS dest
    ON f.dest = dest.faa;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

INNER JOIN is the most common. This is because the result will only include rows in which the values in question are included in both tables. For example, if 
there was a row in flights that included an airline code that was not present in
airlines, then SQL will not include that row in the result.

##### LEFT JOIN
```{python}
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT f.flight,
    a.name AS airline_name,
    orig.name AS origin_name,
    dest.name AS dest_name
FROM flights AS f
LEFT JOIN airlines AS a
    ON f.carrier = a.carrier
LEFT JOIN airports AS orig
    ON f.origin = orig.faa
LEFT JOIN airports AS dest
    ON f.dest = dest.faa;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn).head()
```

LEFT JOIN will return all rows that are in flights regardless of if SQL was able
to find matching rows on the other tables. This is perfectly represented in the
fourth row of the output. On flights, the destination for flight 725 is "BQN"
which is not an airport on the airports table. If you look back to the result of
the INNER JOIN, this row was removed from the result however it is present here
because we used flights as our only reference for rows and therefore the row is
included but the destination name is left as "None"

##### RIGHT JOIN
```{python}
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT f.flight,
    f.origin,
    dest.name AS dest_name
FROM flights AS f
RIGHT JOIN airports AS dest
    ON f.dest = dest.faa;
"""
pd.read_sql_query(query, nycconn)
```

RIGHT JOIN is basically the opposite of LEFT JOIN. Instead of using flights as
its basis for what rows to include, RIGHT JOIN uses the joined tables instead.
As you can see, the fourth row is being skipped again because the airports 
table is being used as reference instead. Also, the table ends with rows for all
destinations from the airports table. SQL includes them because it is looking 
for all rows that include destinations from the airports table. This includes 
all rows from the airports table itself.

### Creating Tables


### Statement Order
Statements in a SQL query must go in a certain order, otherwise the query will return an error. The order is as follows:
 + SELECT
 + FROM
 + JOIN
 + WHERE
 + GROUP BY
 + HAVING
 + ORDER BY
 + LIMIT/OFFSET
