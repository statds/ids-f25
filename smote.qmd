## Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)


This section was written by Hannah Levine, a junior majoring in Applied 
Data Analysis.

### Introduction

In classification problems, imbalanced data refers to skewed class distribution. 
Classification problems use numerical variables to produce a categorical outcome, 
like diagnosing a disease based on clinical data or detecting fraudulent 
transactions. In a simple example, you have 2 classes for a medical diagnosis, 
"healthy" and "not healthy". For rare diseases, there can be a large 
difference in the amount of individuals who are "healthy" and who are "not 
healthy", with the "healthy" far outnumbering the "not healthy". The 
"not healthy" class is known as the minority class.

This is important because machine learning models can become biased towards 
the majority class, and be innacurate in predicting for the minority class. 
This is especially apparent in problems with multiple classes. Adressing this 
class imbalance helps to improve the accuracy of the model. An easy solution 
is to just oversample the minority class, creating duplicates. However, this 
doesn't really add any new information to the model. Another solution is
undersampling of the majority class, but then important information might be left 
out. A better technique is Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique, or SMOTE.

### SMOTE

While random oversampling creates exact replicas of minority observations, SMOTE
creates synthetic samples based on the existing observations in the minority class. 

1. SMOTE identifies minority class(es) in the dataset
2. For each observation in the minority class, SMOTE identifies the k nearest 
neighbors, with k being specified prior (usually k=5).
3. A line is drawn between the minority observation and one of its k nearest neighbors. 
4. The difference is found, multiplied by a random number between 0 and 1, then 
added to the initial observation to generate the synthetic sample.
5. This process is repeated until the desired ratio is reached, usually when 
the minority class equals the size of the majority class.

The resulting dataset is more balanced, but there's less of a chance of
overlapping data points because it's not duplicates.

This can also be demonstrated by the following algorithm:
$$
x_{new} = x_{i} + \lambda(x_{neighbor} - x_{i})
$$
where $x_{i}$ is the selected minority observation, $x_{new}$ is the generated 
synthetic sample, $\lambda$ is a random number between 0 and 1 sampled from a 
uniform distribution, and $x_{neighbor}$ is the randomly chosen neighbor out 
of the identified k neearest neighbors.

### Example: Created Synthetic Dataset

We can generate a random dataset using the `make_classification` function 
from `sklearn.datasets`.

```{python}
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from collections import Counter
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# create imbalanced dataset
X, y = make_classification(
    n_samples=1000,
    n_features=2,
    n_informative=2,
    n_redundant=0,
    n_clusters_per_class=1,
    weights=[0.99, 0.01],
    random_state=1234
)

print(f"Original class distribution: {Counter(y)}")
```

```{python}
# apply SMOTE
smote = SMOTE(random_state=1234)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)

print("After SMOTE class distribution:", Counter(y_resampled))
```

For the application of SMOTE, I only specify a random state to ensure reproducibility. 
Other parameters that can be used are `sampling_strategy` and `k_neighbors`. 
`sampling_strategy` can be a float, string, or dict. Float is only usable for 
problems with 2 classes. For string, the possible choices are:

- "minority": resample only the minority class
- "not minority": resample all but the minority class
- "not majority": resample all but the majority class
- "all": resample all classes
- "auto": same as "not majority", is default 

`k_neighbors` is an int that defaults to 5.

Now we can visualize the distribution of the data.

```{python}
# visualize before and after
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

ax1.scatter(X[y==0][:, 0], X[y==0][:, 1], c="#DEA8FF", label="Majority", alpha=0.5)
ax1.scatter(X[y==1][:, 0], X[y==1][:, 1], c="#A3007D", label="Minority", alpha=0.5)
ax1.set_title("Original class distribution")
ax1.legend()

ax2.scatter(X_resampled[y_resampled==0][:, 0], X_resampled[y_resampled==0][:, 1], c="#DEA8FF",
            label="Majority", alpha=0.5)
ax2.scatter(X_resampled[y_resampled==1][:, 0], X_resampled[y_resampled==1][:, 1], c="#A3007D",
            label="Minority (synthetic)", alpha=0.5)
ax2.set_title("After SMOTE class distribution")
ax2.legend()

plt.show()
```

Looking at the scatter plots, you can see the difference in class size before 
and after using SMOTE. The scatter plot is preferred in this example because 
only 2 classes are being used, and it allows you to see the synthetic minority
points being created between existing minority observations. With other problems
with more classes, it might be easier to look at a bar chart.

Too see if the application of SMOTE actually made a difference, we can look at
models for the original dataset and the after SMOTE dataset.

```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report


X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=1234, stratify=y
)

# original
model_original = LogisticRegression(random_state=1234)
model_original.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_original = model_original.predict(X_test)

print("=== Model trained on ORIGINAL data ===\n")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_original, zero_division=0))
print("\nConfusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_original))
```

Looking at the report, 98% of the cases that were predicted to be class 0
were predicted correctly. 100% of the cases that were actually class 0 were
predicted to be class 0. Meanwhile, 0% of the cases were even predicted to 
be class 1. This is super unrealistic, and it seems like the model
completely ignored the minority class. The confusion matrix suppports this,
it shows that no cases were predicted to be class 1 at all, while 295 cases
were correctly predicted to be class 0 (True Positive), and 5 cases were
incorrectly predicted to be class 0 (False Positive).

```{python}
# SMOTE
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
model_smote = LogisticRegression(random_state=1234)
model_smote.fit(X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled)
y_pred_smote = model_smote.predict(X_test)

print("=== Model trained with SMOTE ===\n")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_smote))
print("\nConfusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_smote))
```

Looking at the model trained with SMOTE data, the report is much more realistic.
80% of the cases that were in class 1 were correctly predicted to be class 1. 
However, only 5% of the cases that were predicted to be class 1 actually were
class 1. The rest were actually class 0. Looking at the confusion matrix,
223 cases were correctly predicted to be class 0 and only 1 case was incorrectly
predicted to be class 0.

### Variations and Extensions of SMOTE

SMOTE is very helpful in addressing class imbalance, but with larger datasets 
and higher-dimensional class spaces other extensions have been 
developed to help handle those larger scenarios. This includes Borderline 
SMOTE, ADASYN, SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE+TOMEK, and SMOTE-NC.

**Borderline SMOTE** was desgined to address the misclassification of minority
class observations that are near or on the borderline between classes.
Because they are on or near the borderlines, they are harder to classify
and more likely to be mislabeled. Borderline SMOTE generates more synthetic
samples near the borderlines between the majority and minority classes,
providing more challenging observations to classify in hopes that it will
improve the performance of classifiers.

**ADASYN**, or Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach, focuses on finding and
handling regions where the imbalance is more severe. For each minority
class observation, ADASYN measures how many of its k nearest neighbors
belong to the majority class. If the minority observation has more nearest
neighbors that are a part of the majority class, it is considered a
high density area. The algorithm then generates more synthetic samples in the 
higher density regions, which are the regions with a greater imbalance. This 
allows the dataset to become more uniform by balancing more severely imbalanced areas.

**SMOTE-ENN**, or SMOTE Edited Nearest Neighbors, combines SMOTE with the 
ENN rule. The ENN rule is used to remove misclassified samples. The point
of combining these techniques is to improve the overall quality of the
dataset. SMOTE is applied first to generate synthetic samples, then ENN 
is used to remove both synthetic and original samples that have a majority 
of their nearest neighbors that are the opposite class. This provides a cleaner
dataset with more distinct classes.

**SMOTE-TOMEK** links combine SMOTE and TOMEK links. TOMEK links are pairs of
very close instances that are in opposite classes. By removing these links,
overlap between classes is reduced and the classes are more distinct.
For every observation in the dataset, the nearest neighbor from the same class
and the nearest neighbor from the opposite class is found. Each pair of 
observations is analyzed to see if it forms a TOMEK link. If a link is found,
the two observations are marked for removal. Once all TOMEK links have been found, 
the observations that are involved are removed. This technique also reduces 
overlap between classes, and improves the distinction of classes.

**SMOTE-NC**, or SMOTE Nominal Continuous, is used for datasets that
are mixed nominal (categorical) and continuous variables. SMOTE is great
when dealing with datasets with only numerical variables, but runs into
problems when there are categorical variables. SMOTE operates in the numerical
differences between observations and their neighbors, so categorical variables
don't work with it. SMOTE-NC addresses this by seperately considering
the categorical variables, and ensuring the categorical features of the
synthetic samples align with those of the original data.

### Conclusion

SMOTE is a great tool to handle imbalanced classes in datasets. By creating
synthetic samples from real observations in the minority class, the dataset
is balanced while still having a good range of information and not overfitting. 
It's important to note that SMOTE does not guaruntee that a model will perform 
well. It can help with prediction on the minority class, but it doesn't always 
mean that the overall performance of the model improves. It also can create
noisy samples in dense or overlapping regions. It's important to analyze the 
problem to determine if SMOTE is worth applying, or if another method might be better.
