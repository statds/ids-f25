### Introduction

In classification problems, imbalanced data refers to skewed class
distribution. Classification problems use numerical variables to 
produce a categorical outcome, like diagnosing a disease based on clinical
data or detecting fraudulent transactions. In a simple example, you have
2 classes for a medical diagnosis, "healthy" and "not healthy". For rare
diseases, there can be a large difference in the amount of individuals
who are "healthy" and who are "not healthy", with the "healthy"
far outnumbering the "not healthy". The "not healthy" class is
known as the minority class.

This is important because models can become biased towards the majority
class, and be innacurate in predicting for the minority class. In the case
of disease diagnosis, this is especially apparent, as the models are used
to diagnose the unhealthy individuals. Adressing this class imbalance
helps to improve the accuracy of the model. An easy solution is to just
oversample the minority class, creating duplicates. However, this doesn't
really add any new information to the model. Another solution is
undersampling of the majority class, but then important information
might be left out. A better technique is Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling
Technique, or SMOTE.

### SMOTE

load example dataset

```{python}
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from collections import Counter
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

X, y = make_classification(
    n_samples=1000,
    n_features=10,
    n_informative=3,
    n_redundant=1,
    n_classes=2,
    weights=[0.99, 0.01],
    random_state=1234
)

print(f"Class distribution: {Counter(y)}")
```
