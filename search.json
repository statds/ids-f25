    "text": "Adapting to Rapid Skill Acquisition\nIn this course, students are expected to rapidly acquire new skills, a critical aspect of data science. To emphasize this, consider this insightful quote from VanderPlas (2016):\n\nWhen a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member, or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it’s less a matter of knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown answer. In data science it’s the same: searchable web resources such as online documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you’ve found yourself searching before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don’t know, whether through a web search engine or another means.\n\nThis quote captures the essence of what we aim to develop in our students: the ability to swiftly navigate and utilize the vast resources available to solve complex problems in data science. Examples tasks are: install needed software (or even hardware); search and find solutions to encountered problems.",

She defines \\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\mbox{Data Science} =\n\\mbox{S}\\mbox{D}\\mbox{C}^3,\n\\end{equation*}\\] where\nComputing underscores the need for proficiency in programming and algorithmic thinking, collaboration/teamwork reflects the inherently collaborative nature of data science projects, often requiring teams with diverse skill sets, and communication to outsiders emphasizes the importance of translating complex data insights into understandable and actionable information for non-experts.\nThis definition neatly captures the essence of data science, emphasizing a balance between technical skills, teamwork, and the ability to communicate effectively.",

    "section": "1.3 Computing Environment",
    "text": "1.3 Computing Environment\nAll setups are operating system dependent. As soon as possible, stay away from Windows. Otherwise, good luck (you will need it).\n\n1.3.1 Operating System\nYour computer has an operating system (OS), which is responsible for managing the software packages on your computer. Each operating system has its own package management system. For example:\n\nLinux: Linux distributions have a variety of package managers depending on the distribution. For instance, Ubuntu uses APT (Advanced Package Tool), Fedora uses DNF (Dandified Yum), and Arch Linux uses Pacman. These package managers are integral to the Linux experience, allowing users to install, update, and manage software packages easily from repositories.\nmacOS: macOS uses Homebrew as its primary package manager. Homebrew simplifies the installation of software and tools that aren’t included in the standard macOS installation, using simple commands in the terminal.\nWindows: Windows users often rely on the Microsoft Store for apps and software. For more developer-focused package management, tools like Chocolatey and Windows Package Manager (Winget) are used. Additionally, recent versions of Windows have introduced the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL allows Windows users to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, unifying Windows and Linux applications and tools. This is particularly useful for developers and data scientists who need to run Linux-specific software or scripts. It saves a lot of trouble Windows users used to have that users previously faced before WSL was introduced.\n\nUnderstanding the package management system of your operating system is crucial for effectively managing and installing software, especially for data science tools and applications.\n\n\n1.3.2 File System\nA file system is a fundamental aspect of a computer’s operating system, responsible for managing how data is stored and retrieved on a storage device, such as a hard drive, SSD, or USB flash drive. Essentially, it provides a way for the OS and users to organize and keep track of files. Different operating systems typically use different file systems. For instance, NTFS and FAT32 are common in Windows, APFS and HFS+ in macOS, and Ext4 in many Linux distributions. Each file system has its own set of rules for controlling the allocation of space on the drive and the naming, storage, and access of files, which impacts performance, security, and compatibility. Understanding file systems is crucial for tasks such as data recovery, disk partitioning, and managing file permissions, making it an important concept for anyone working with computers, especially in data science and IT fields.\nNavigating through folders in the command line, especially in Unix-like environments such as Linux or macOS, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), is an essential skill for effective file management. The command cd (change directory) is central to this process. To move into a specific directory, you use cd followed by the directory name, like cd Documents. To go up one level in the directory hierarchy, you use cd ... To return to the home directory, simply typing cd or cd ~ will suffice. The ls command lists all files and folders in the current directory, providing a clear view of your options for navigation. Mastering these commands, along with others like pwd (print working directory), which displays your current directory, equips you with the basics of moving around the file system in the command line, an indispensable skill for a wide range of computing tasks in Unix-like systems.\n\n\n1.3.3 Command Line Interface\nOn Linux or MacOS, simply open a terminal.\nOn Windows, several options can be considered.\n\nWindows Subsystem Linux (WSL): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/\nCygwin (with X): https://x.cygwin.com\nGit Bash: https://www.gitkraken.com/blog/what-is-git-bash\n\nTo jump-start, here is a tutorial: Ubuntu Linux for beginners.\nAt least, you need to know how to handle files and traverse across directories. The tab completion and introspection supports are very useful.\nHere are several commonly used shell commands:\n\ncd: change directory; .. means parent directory.\npwd: present working directory.\nls: list the content of a folder; -l long version; -a show hidden files; -t ordered by modification time.\nmkdir: create a new directory.\ncp: copy file/folder from a source to a target.\nmv: move file/folder from a source to a target.\nrm: remove a file a folder.\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Python\nSet up Python on your computer:\n\nPython 3.\nPython package manager miniconda or pip.\nIntegrated Development Environment (IDE) (Jupyter Notebook; RStudio; VS Code; Emacs; etc.)\n\nI will be using VS Code in class.\nReadability is important! Check your Python coding style against the recommended styles: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/. A good place to start is the Section on “Code Lay-out”.\nOnline books on Python for data science:\n\n“Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data,” First Edition, by Jake VanderPlas, O’Reilly Media, 2016.\n“Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython.” Third Edition, by Wes McKinney, O’Reilly Media, 2022.",

    "text": "3.2 Compiling the Classnotes\nThe sources of the classnotes are at https://github.com/statds/ids-s25. This is also the source tree that you will contributed to this semester. I expect that you clone the repository to your own computer, update it frequently, and compile the latest version on your computer (reproducibility).\nTo compile the classnotes, you need the following tools: Git, Quarto, and Python.\n\n3.2.1 Set up your Python Virtual Environment\nI suggest that a Python virtual environment for the classnotes be set up in the current directory for reproducibility. A Python virtual environment is simply a directory with a particular file structure, which contains a specific Python interpreter and software libraries and binaries needed to support a project. It allows us to isolate our Python development projects from our system installed Python and other Python environments.\nTo create a Python virtual environment for our classnotes:\npython3 -m venv .ids-s25-venv\nHere .ids-s25-venv is the name of the virtual environment to be created. Choose an informative name. This only needs to be set up once.\nTo activate this virtual environment:\n. .ids-s25-venv/bin/activate\nAfter activating the virtual environment, you will see (.ids-s25-venv) at the beginning of your shell prompt. Then, the Python interpreter and packages needed will be the local versions in this virtual environment without interfering your system-wide installation or other virtual environments.\nTo install the Python packages that are needed to compile the classnotes, we have a requirements.txt file that specifies the packages and their versions. They can be installed easily with:\npip install -r requirements.txt\nIf you are interested in learning how to create the requirements.txt file, just put your question into a Google search.\nTo exit the virtual environment, simply type deactivate in your command line. This will return you to your system’s global Python environment.\n\n\n3.2.2 Clone the Repository\nClone the repository to your own computer. In a terminal (command line), go to an appropriate directory (folder), and clone the repo. For example, if you use ssh for authentication:\ngit clone git@github.com:statds/ids-s25.git\n\n\n3.2.3 Render the Classnotes\nAssuming quarto has been set up, we render the classnotes in the cloned repository\ncd ids-s25\nquarto render\nIf there are error messages, search and find solutions to clear them. Otherwise, the html version of the notes will be available under _book/index.html, which is default location of the output.\n\n\n3.2.4 Login Requirements\nFor some illustrations, you need to interact with certain sites that require account information. For example, for Google map services, you need to save your API key in a file named api_key.txt in the root folder of the source. Another example is to access the US Census API, where you would need to register an account and get your Census API Key.",

    "text": "4.5 Variables versus Objects\nIn Python, variables and the objects they point to actually live in two different places in the computer memory. Think of variables as pointers to the objects they’re associated with, rather than being those objects. This matters when multiple variables point to the same object.\n\nx = [1, 2, 3]  # create a list; x points to the list\ny = x          # y also points to the same list in the memory\ny.append(4)    # append to y\nx              # x changed!\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n\nNow check their addresses\n\nprint(id(x))   # address of x\nprint(id(y))   # address of y\n\n4465247232\n4465247232\n\n\nNonetheless, some data types in Python are “immutable”, meaning that their values cannot be changed in place. One such example is strings.\n\nx = \"abc\"\ny = x\ny = \"xyz\"\nx\n\n'abc'\n\n\nNow check their addresses\n\nprint(id(x))   # address of x\nprint(id(y))   # address of y\n\n4411247472\n4498862656\n\n\nQuestion: What’s mutable and what’s immutable?\nAnything that is a collection of other objects is mutable, except tuples.\nNot all manipulations of mutable objects change the object rather than create a new object. Sometimes when you do something to a mutable object, you get back a new object. Manipulations that change an existing object, rather than create a new one, are referred to as “in-place mutations” or just “mutations.” So:\n\nAll manipulations of immutable types create new objects.\nSome manipulations of mutable types create new objects.\n\nDifferent variables may all be pointing at the same object is preserved through function calls (a behavior known as “pass by object-reference”). So if you pass a list to a function, and that function manipulates that list using an in-place mutation, that change will affect any variable that was pointing to that same object outside the function.\n\nx = [1, 2, 3]\ny = x\n\ndef append_42(input_list):\n    input_list.append(42)\n    return input_list\n\nappend_42(x)\n\n[1, 2, 3, 42]\n\n\nNote that both x and y have been appended by \\(42\\).",

The bottom line is that, of course, not every real number is exactly representable.\nIf you have played the Game 24, here is a tricky one:\n\n8 / (3 - 8 / 3) == 24\n\nFalse\n\n\nSurprise?\nThere are more.\n\n0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3\n\nFalse\n\n\n\n0.3 - 0.2 == 0.1\n\nFalse\n\n\nWhat is really going on?\n\nimport decimal\ndecimal.Decimal(0.1)\n\nDecimal('0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625')\n\n\n\ndecimal.Decimal(8 / (3 - 8 / 3))\n\nDecimal('23.999999999999989341858963598497211933135986328125')\n\n\nBecause the mantissa bits are limited, it can not represent a floating point that’s both very big and very precise. Most computers can represent all integers up to \\(2^{53}\\), after that it starts skipping numbers.\n\n2.1 ** 53 + 1 == 2.1 ** 53\n\n# Find a number larger than 2 to the 53rd\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nx = 2.1 ** 53\nfor i in range(1000000):\n    x = x + 1\nx == 2.1 ** 53\n\nTrue\n\n\nWe add 1 to x by 1000000 times, but it still equal to its initial value, 2.1 ** 53. This is because this number is too big that computer can’t handle it with precision like add 1.\nMachine epsilon is the smallest positive floating-point number x such that 1 + x != 1.\n\nprint(np.finfo(float).eps)\nprint(np.finfo(np.float32).eps)\n\n2.220446049250313e-16\n1.1920929e-07",

    "text": "4.7 Virtual Environment\nVirtual environments in Python are essential tools for managing dependencies and ensuring consistency across projects. They allow you to create isolated environments for each project, with its own set of installed packages, separate from the global Python installation. This isolation prevents conflicts between project dependencies and versions, making your projects more reliable and easier to manage. It’s particularly useful when working on multiple projects with differing requirements, or when collaborating with others who may have different setups.\nTo set up a virtual environment, you first need to ensure that Python is installed on your system. Most modern Python installations come with the venv module, which is used to create virtual environments. Here’s how to set one up:\n\nOpen your command line interface.\nNavigate to your project directory.\nRun python3 -m venv myenv, where myenv is the name of the virtual environment to be created. Choose an informative name.\n\nThis command creates a new directory named myenv (or your chosen name) in your project directory, containing the virtual environment.\nTo start using this environment, you need to activate it. The activation command varies depending on your operating system:\n\nOn Windows, run myenv\\Scripts\\activate.\nOn Linux or MacOS, use source myenv/bin/activate or . myenv/bin/activate.\n\nOnce activated, your command line will typically show the name of the virtual environment, and you can then install and use packages within this isolated environment without affecting your global Python setup.\nTo exit the virtual environment, simply type deactivate in your command line. This will return you to your system’s global Python environment.\nAs an example, let’s install a package, like numpy, in this newly created virtual environment:\n\nEnsure your virtual environment is activated.\nRun pip install numpy.\n\nThis command installs the requests library in your virtual environment. You can verify the installation by running pip list, which should show requests along with its version.",

    "text": "Quarto and Git setup Quarto and Git are two important tools for data science. Get familiar with them through the following tasks. Please use the templates/hw.qmd template to document, for each step, what you did, the obstacles you encountered, and how you overcame them. Think of this as a user manual for students who are new to this. Use the command line interface.\n\nSet up SSH authentication between your computer and your GitHub account.\nInstall Quarto onto your computer following the instructions of Get Started.\nPick a tool of your choice (e.g., VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, Positron, Emacs, etc.), follow the instructions to reproduce the example of line plot on polar axis.\nRender the homework into a HTML.\nPrint the HTML file to a pdf file and put the file into a release in your GitHub repo.\n\nWorking on Homework Problems All the requirements on homework styles have reasons. Reviewing these questions help you to understand them.\n\nWhat are the differences between binary and source files?\nWhy do we not want to track binary files in a repo?\nWhy do I require pdf output via release?\nWhy do I not want your files added via ‘upload’?\nWhy do I require line width under 80?\nWhy is it not a good idea to have spaces in file/folder names?\nWhy do I require at least 10 commits for each assignment?\n\nContributing to the Class Notes To contribute to the classnotes, you need to have a working copy of the sources on your computer. Document the following steps in a qmd file in the form of a step-by-step manual, as if you are explaining them to someone who wants to contribute too. Make at least 10 commits for this task, each with an informative message.\n\nCreate a fork of the notes repo into your own GitHub account.\nClone it to an appropriate folder on your computer.\nRender the classnotes on your computer; document the obstacles and solutions.\nMake a new branch (and name it appropriately) to experiment with your changes.\nCheckout your branch and add your wishes to the wish list; commit with an informative message; and push the changes to your GitHub account.\nMake a pull request to class notes repo from your fork at GitHub. Make sure you have clear messages to document the changes.\n\nMonty Hall Consider a generalized Monty Hall experiment. Suppose that the game start with \\(n\\) doors; after you pick one, the host opens \\(m \\le n - 2\\) doors, that show no award. Include sufficient text around the code chunks to explain them.\n\nWrite a function to simulate the experiment once. The function takes two arguments ndoors and nempty, which represent the number of doors and the number of empty doors showed by the host, respectively, It returns the result of two strategies, switch and no-switch, from playing this game.\nPlay this game with 3 doors and 1 empty a few times.\nPlay this game with 10 doors and 8 empty a few times.\nWrite a function to demonstrate the Monty Hall problem through simulation. The function takes three arguments ndoors, nempty, and ntrials, where ntrial is the number of trials in a simulation. The function should return the proportion of wins for both the switch and no-switch strategy.\nApply your function with 3 doors (1 empty) and 10 doors (8 empty), both with 1000 trials. Summarize your results.\n\nApproximating \\(\\pi\\) Write a function to do a Monte Carlo approximation of \\(\\pi\\). The function takes a Monte Carlo sample size n as input, and returns a point estimate of \\(\\pi\\) and a 95% confidence interval. Apply your function with sample size 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000. Repeat the experiment 1000 times for each sample size and check the empirical probability that the confidence intervals cover the true value of \\(\\pi\\). Comment on the results.\nGoogle Billboard Ad Find the first 10-digit prime number occurring in consecutive digits of \\(e\\). This was a Google recruiting ad.\nGame 24 The math game 24 is one of the addictive games among number lovers. With four randomly selected cards from a deck of poker cards, use all four values and elementary arithmetic operations (\\(+-\\times /\\)) to come up with 24. Let \\(\\square\\) be one of the four numbers. Let \\(\\bigcirc\\) represent one of the four operators. For example, \\[\\begin{equation*}\n(\\square \\bigcirc \\square) \\bigcirc (\\square \\bigcirc \\square)\n\\end{equation*}\\] is one way to group the the operations.\n\nList all the possible ways to group the four numbers.\nHow many possible ways are there to check for a solution?\nWrite a function to solve the problem in a brutal force way. The inputs of the function are four numbers. The function returns a list of solutions. Some of the solutions will be equivalent, but let us not worry about that for now.\n\nNYC Crash Data Cleaning The NYC motor vehicle collisions data with documentation is available from NYC Open Data. The raw data needs some cleaning.\n\nUse the filter from the website to download the crash data of the week of June 30, 2024 in CSV format; save it under a directory data with an informative name (e.g., nyccrashes_2024w0630_by20240916.csv); read the data into a Panda data frame with careful handling of the date time variables.\nClean up the variable names. Use lower cases and replace spaces with underscores.\nCheck the crash date and time to see if they really match the filter we intented. Remove the extra rows if needed.\nGet the basic summaries of each variables: missing percentage; descriptive statistics for continuous variables; frequency tables for discrete variables.\nAre their invalid longitude and latitude in the data? If so, replace them with NA.\nAre there zip_code values that are not legit NYC zip codes? If so, replace them with NA.\nAre there missing in zip_code and borough? Do they always co-occur?\nAre there cases where zip_code and borough are missing but the geo codes are not missing? If so, fill in zip_code and borough using the geo codes.\nIs it redundant to keep both location and the longitude/latitude at the NYC Open Data server?\nCheck the frequency of crash_time by hour. Is there a matter of bad luck at exactly midnight? How would you interpret this?\nAre the number of persons killed/injured the summation of the numbers of pedestrians, cyclist, and motorists killed/injured? If so, is it redundant to keep these two columns at the NYC Open Data server?\nPrint the whole frequency table of contributing_factor_vehicle_1. Convert lower cases to uppercases and check the frequencies again.\nProvided an opportunity to meet the data provider, what suggestions would you make based on your data exploration experience?\n\nNYC Crash Data Exploration Except for the first question, use the cleaned crash data in feather format.\n\nConstruct a contigency table for missing in geocode (latitude and longitude) by borough. Is the missing pattern the same across boroughs? Formulate a hypothesis and test it.\nConstruct a hour variable with integer values from 0 to 23. Plot the histogram of the number of crashes by hour. Plot it by borough.\nOverlay the locations of the crashes on a map of NYC. The map could be a static map or a Google map.\nCreate a new variable severe which is one if the number of persons injured or deaths is 1 or more; and zero otherwise. Construct a cross table for severe versus borough. Is the severity of the crashes the same across boroughs? Test the null hypothesis that the two variables are not associated with an appropriate test.\nMerge the crash data with the Census zip code database which contains zip-code level demographic or socioeconomic variables.\nFit a logistic model with severe as the outcome variable and covariates that are available in the data or can be engineered from the data. For example, zip code level covariates obtained from merging with the zip code database; crash hour; number of vehicles involved.\n\nNYC Crash severity modeling Using the cleaned NYC crash data, merged with zipcode level information, predict severe of a crash.\n\nSet random seed to 1234. Randomly select 20% of the crashes as testing data and leave the rest 80% as training data.\nFit a logistic model on the training data and validate the performance on the testing data. Explain the confusion matrix result from the testing data. Compute the F1 score.\nFit a logistic model on the training data with \\(L_1\\) regularization. Select the tuning parameter with 5-fold cross-validation in F1 score\nApply the regularized logistic regression to predict the severity of the crashes in the testing data. Compare the performance of the two logistic models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.\n\nMidterm project: Street flood in NYC The class presentation at the 2025 NYC Open Data Weeik is scheduled for Monday, March 24, 2:00-3:00 pm.\nThe NYC Open Data of 311 Service Requests contains all service requests from 2010 to the present. This analysis focuses on two sewer-related complaints in 2024: Street Flooding (SF) and Catch Basin (CB). SF complaints serve as a practical indicator of street flooding, while CB complaints provide insights into a key infrastructural factor—when catch basins fail to drain rainwater properly due to blockages or structural issues, water accumulates on the streets. SF complaints are typically filed when residents observe standing water or flooding, whereas CB complaints report clogged basins, defective grates, or other drainage problems. The dataset is available in CSV format as data/nycflood2024.csv. Refer to the online data dictionary for a detailed explanation of variable meanings. Try to tell a story in your report while going through the questions.\n\nData cleaning.\n\nImport the data, rename the columns with our preferred styles.\nSummarize the missing information. Are there variables that are close to completely missing?\nAre there redundant information in the data? Try storing the data using the Arrow format and comment on the efficiency gain.\nAre there invalid NYC zipcode or borough? Can some of the missing values be filled? Fill them if yes.\nAre there date errors? Examples are earlier closed_date than created_date; closed_date and created_date matching to the second; dates exactly at midnight or noon to the second.\nSummarize your suggestions to the data curator in several bullet points.\n\nExploratory analysis.\n\nVisualize the locations of complaints on a NYC map, with different symbols for different descriptors.\nCreate a variable response_time, which is the duration from created_date to closed_date.\nVisualize the comparison of response time by complaint descriptor and borough. The original may not be the best given the long tail or outlers.\nIs there significant difference in response time between SF and CB complaints? Across different boroughs? Does the difference between SF and CB depend on borough? State your hypothesis, justify your test, and summarize your results in plain English.\nCreate a binary variable over3d to indicate that a service request took three days or longer to close.\nDoes over3d depend on the complaint descriptor, borough, or weekday (vs weekend/holiday)? State your hypotheses, justify your test, and summarize your results.\n\nModeling the occurrence of overly long response time.\n\nCreate a data set which contains the outcome variable over3d and variables that might be useful in predicting it. Consider including time-of-day effects (e.g., rush hour vs. late-night), seasonal trends, and neighborhood-level demographics. Zip code level information could be useful too, such as the zip code area and the ACS 2023 variables (data/nyc_zip_areas.feather and data/acs2023.feather).\nRandomly select 20% of the complaints as testing data with seeds 1234. Build a logistic model to predict over3d for the complaints with the training data. If you have tuning parameters, justify how they were selected.\nConstruct the confusion matrix from your prediction with a threshold of 1/2 on both training and testing data. Explain your accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score to a New Yorker.\nConstruct the ROC curve of your fitted logistic model and obtain the AUROC for both training and testing data. Explain your results to a New Yorker.\nIdentify the most important predictors of over3d. Use model coefficients or feature importance (e.g., odds ratios, standardized coefficients, or SHAP values).\nSummarize your results to a New Yorker who is not data science savvy in several bullet points.\n\nModeling the count of SF complains by zip code.\n\nCreate a data set by aggregate the count of SF and SB complains by day for each zipcode.\nMerge the NYC precipitation (data/rainfall_CP.csv), by day to this data set.\nMerge the NYC zip code level landscape variables (data/nyc_zip_lands.csv) and ACS 2023 variables into the data set.\nFor each day, create two variables representing 1-day lag of the precipitation and the number of CB complaints.\nFilter data from March 1 to November 30, excluding winter months when flooding is less frequent. November 30.\nCompare a Poisson regression with a Negative Binomial regression to account for overdispersion. Which model fits better? Explain the results to a New Yorker.",
