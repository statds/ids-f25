# Data Visualization

In this chapter we embrace visualization as a cornerstone of modern
data-analysis workflows: turning raw numbers into meaningful visuals
that support insight, decision-making and communication. We begin by
exploring static and information-rich graphics through `plotnine`,
building on the grammar‐of-graphics approach. Next we extend into
spatial data-visualisation using `GeoPandas`, equipping you to map,
project and interpret geospatial patterns. Later sections will
introduce further tools and techniques (for example interactive maps
or dashboards), but throughout we emphasise the same core questions:
Which visual form fits the data and question? How do our design and
implementation choices influence what the viewer sees — and what they
don’t see? With the tools and principles in hand, you’ll be prepared
to insert clear, effective visualisation into your data-science
project workflow.
