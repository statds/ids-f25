### Introduction

Here is an overview.


### Basic Creation

```{python}
pip install gmplot
```

Put materials on topic 1 here

Python examples can be put into `python` code chunks:

```{python}
# import pandas as pd
import gmplot
api_key = 'AIzaSyDQGVco57cmHijHnzNqsytpOWeWTE5yOlQ'

# UConn Storrs center
center_lat, center_lng = 41.8079, -72.2546

gmap = gmplot.GoogleMapPlotter(center_lat, center_lng, 15, apikey = api_key)

gmap.draw("uconn_base.html")
# do something
```

### Plotting Points

```{python}
gmap2 = gmplot.GoogleMapPlotter(center_lat, center_lng, 15, apikey = api_key)
# Student Union
gmap2.marker(41.8069, -72.2543, color='blue', title="Student Union")

# Gampel Pavilion
gmap2.marker(41.8052, -72.2544, color='red', title="Gampel Pavilion")

# Homer Babbidge Library
gmap2.marker(41.8067, -72.2520, color='green', title="Library")

gmap2.draw("uconn_markers.html")
```
