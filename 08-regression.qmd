# Regression Models {# ch-regression}


Regression is a fundamental tool in data science and statistics for
modeling relationships between variables. It provides a framework to
explain how a response variable changes when one or more explanatory
variables vary, and it serves as a foundation for prediction,
interpretation, and decision making. Regression models are used in a
wide range of applications, from estimating the effect of education on
income to predicting housing prices based on property characteristics.


## Introduction

This chapter introduces regression through a unified set of examples
using the Ames Housing dataset. The dataset contains detailed
information about housing sales in Ames, Iowa. It has become a popular
benchmark for regression tasks, replacing the older Boston Housing
dataset due to its larger size and richer set of features. Throughout
the chapter, we will use this dataset to illustrate concepts of
regression modeling, including model formulation, fitting, diagnosis,
and extensions such as regularization, GLM, and GAM. Because many
variables in the dataset record absence with NA (for example, NA in the
alley variable indicates no alley access), careful preprocessing is
required before modeling.


### Ames Housing Data Cleaning
The Ames housing data will be used for illustration, but it requires
careful preprocessing. A distinctive feature of this dataset is that
many `NA` values do not represent missing information but instead denote
the absence of a feature. Treating them as missing would discard useful
signals, so they should be recoded explicitly.

First, we retrieve the data to ensure reproducibility.

```{python}
import openml
import pandas as pd

# Load Ames Housing dataset (OpenML ID 42165)
dataset = openml.datasets.get_dataset(42165)
df, *_ = dataset.get_data()
```

For categorical variables, `NA` often means that the property does not
have the feature. For example, `Alley` is `NA` when no alley access
exists, `FireplaceQu` is `NA` when no fireplace is present, and `PoolQC`
is `NA` when the house does not have a pool. In these cases, `NA`
should be replaced with an explicit category such as "None."

```{python}
none_cols = [
    "Alley", "FireplaceQu", "PoolQC", "Fence", "MiscFeature",
    "GarageType", "GarageFinish", "GarageQual", "GarageCond",
    "BsmtQual", "BsmtCond", "BsmtExposure", "BsmtFinType1",
    "BsmtFinType2", "MasVnrType"
]
for col in none_cols:
    df[col] = df[col].fillna("None")
```

For numeric variables, `NA` may also indicate absence. Examples include
`GarageCars`, `GarageArea`, and basement square footage variables. When
no garage or basement is present, the correct encoding is zero. Thus,
these columns should be filled with 0 rather than treated as missing.

```{python}
zero_cols = [
    "GarageCars", "GarageArea",
    "BsmtFinSF1", "BsmtFinSF2", "BsmtUnfSF",
    "TotalBsmtSF", "BsmtFullBath", "BsmtHalfBath",
    "MasVnrArea"
]
for col in zero_cols:
    df[col] = df[col].fillna(0)
```

Finally, some variables contain genuinely missing data. A common example
is `LotFrontage`, which records the linear feet of street connected to a
property. Here `NA` values reflect unavailable measurements. These can
be imputed using summary statistics such as the median or by more
advanced methods if desired.

```{python}
df["LotFrontage"] = df["LotFrontage"].fillna(df["LotFrontage"].median())
```

This structured cleaning step ensures that absence is distinguished from
missingness, numeric zero values are meaningful, and true missing values
are handled appropriately. Only after this preparation is the dataset
ready for modeling.


## Linear Regression Model

The starting point of regression analysis is the specification of a
model that links a response variable to one or more explanatory
variables. In the simplest form, the relationship is described by a
linear function plus an error term:

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \cdots + \beta_p X_{ip} + \varepsilon_i,
$$

where $Y_i$ is the response for observation $i$, $X_{ij}$ are the
explanatory variables, $\beta_j$ are unknown coefficients, and
$\\varepsilon_i$ is a random error term. The model asserts that
systematic variation in the response is captured by a linear
combination of predictors, while unsystematic variation is left to the
error.


For linear regression to yield valid estimates and inference, several
assumptions are commonly made. The form of the mean function is assumed
linear in parameters. The error terms are assumed to have mean zero and
constant variance, and to be independent across observations. When
sample sizes are small, normality of the errors is sometimes assumed to
justify exact inference. With larger samples, asymptotic results make
this assumption less critical, and estimation of coefficients by least
squares does not require it. Finally, explanatory variables should not
be perfectly collinear. These assumptions guide model fitting and
motivate the diagnostic checks that follow.

### Fitting

Fitting a regression model means finding estimates of the coefficients
that make the model align with observed data. The most common approach
is ordinary least squares, which minimizes the sum of squared residuals:

$$
L(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 X_{i1} - \cdots - \beta_p X_{ip})^2.
$$

Here $L(\beta)$ is the loss function, measuring how far predictions are
from observed responses. Minimizing this quadratic loss yields closed
form solutions for the coefficient estimates when predictors are not
perfectly collinear. Computationally, this involves solving the normal
equations or using matrix decompositions such as QR or singular value
decomposition, which provide stable and efficient solutions.

This framework also sets the stage for extensions. By modifying the loss
function to include penalty terms, one obtains regularization methods
such as ridge regression or the lasso. The optimization remains similar
in spirit but balances data fit with model complexity. Later sections
will show how these modifications improve prediction and interpretability
when many predictors are involved.


Housing prices are highly skewed, with a long right tail. To stabilize
variance and make the model fit better, it is common to use the log of
`SalePrice` as the response:

$$
Y_i = \log(\text{SalePrice}_i).
$$

We add this transformed response to the dataset.

```{python}
import numpy as np

df["LogPrice"] = np.log(df["SalePrice"])
```

Many studies and analyses of the Ames data have found certain variables
to be consistently important for predicting sale price. These include
`OverallQual` (overall material and finish quality), `GrLivArea` (above-
ground living area), `GarageCars` (garage capacity), `TotalBsmtSF`
(total basement area), `YearBuilt` (construction year), `FullBath`
(number of full bathrooms), and `KitchenQual` (kitchen quality). We will
focus on these predictors to illustrate model fitting.

Instead of manually creating dummy variables, we can use the formula API
from `statsmodels`, which handles categorical predictors internally.

```{python}
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

formula = (
    "LogPrice ~ OverallQual + GrLivArea + GarageCars + "
    "TotalBsmtSF + YearBuilt + FullBath + C(KitchenQual)"
)
```

We then fit the regression model directly with the formula.

```{python}
model = smf.ols(formula, data=df).fit()
```

Finally, we examine the regression results, which highlight the most
important predictors of log sale price.

```{python}
model.summary()
```

The output gives estimated coefficients, standard errors, and measures
of fit. At this stage, several questions naturally arise:

- How should we interpret a coefficient when the outcome is on the log
  scale? For instance, what does a one-unit increase in `OverallQual`
  imply for expected sale price?
- How do we compare the importance of variables measured on different
  scales, such as square footage and construction year?
- What role do categorical variables like `KitchenQual` play, and how
  do we interpret their dummy coefficients relative to the baseline?
- Which predictors are statistically significant, and does significance
  necessarily imply practical importance?
- How well does the model explain variation in housing prices, and what
  limitations might remain?

These questions guide us in interpreting the fitted model and connect
directly to the diagnostic checks discussed in the next section.

### Diagnosis


Once a regression model has been fitted, it is essential to examine
whether the underlying assumptions hold and whether the model provides a
useful description of the data. Diagnostics help identify potential
problems such as non-linearity, heteroscedasticity, influential points,
and violations of independence.

The first step is to examine residuals, defined as the difference
between observed and fitted values:

$$
\hat{\varepsilon}_i = Y_i - \hat{Y}_i.
$$

Plotting residuals against fitted values reveals whether variance is
constant and whether systematic patterns remain.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fitted_vals = model.fittedvalues
residuals = model.resid

plt.scatter(fitted_vals, residuals, alpha=0.5)
plt.axhline(0, color="red", linestyle="--")
plt.xlabel("Fitted values")
plt.ylabel("Residuals")
plt.title("Residuals vs Fitted")
plt.show()
```

Another check is the distribution of residuals. A histogram or Q-Q plot
can indicate whether residuals are approximately normal, which is most
relevant for inference in small samples.

```{python}
plt.hist(residuals, bins=30, edgecolor="black")
plt.xlabel("Residuals")
plt.title("Histogram of residuals")
plt.show()

influence = model.get_influence()
std_resid = influence.resid_studentized_internal

import statsmodels.api as sm
sm.qqplot(std_resid, line="45")
plt.title("Q-Q plot of residuals")
plt.show()
```

Influential observations can distort regression results. Leverage and
Cook’s distance are standard measures to detect such points.

```{python}
cooks = influence.cooks_distance[0]

plt.scatter(fitted_vals, cooks, alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel("Fitted values")
plt.ylabel("Cook's distance")
plt.title("Influence diagnostics")
plt.show()
```

Key questions to raise at this stage are:

- Do residuals appear randomly scattered, suggesting the linear model is
  adequate?
- Is there evidence of non-constant variance or other systematic
  patterns?
- Are residuals approximately normal, and does this matter given the
  sample size?
- Which points exert disproportionate influence on the fitted model?

These diagnostic tools guide improvements, such as transformations,
adding interaction terms, or considering alternative modeling
approaches.


## Regularized Regression

### Motivation

Ordinary least squares can perform poorly when there are many predictors
or when predictors are highly correlated. In such cases, estimated
coefficients become unstable and prediction accuracy suffers.
Regularization introduces penalties on the size of coefficients, leading
to simpler and more robust models.

To illustrate, we return to the Ames data. Suppose we fit a model with a
large set of predictors. Ordinary least squares will attempt to explain
every fluctuation in the data, potentially overfitting. A regularized
approach reduces this risk by shrinking coefficients, improving
out-of-sample prediction.

### Formulation

The penalized regression framework modifies the least squares objective:

$$
L(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_i^\top \beta)^2 + \lambda P(\beta),
$$

where $P(\beta)$ is a penalty function and $\lambda$ controls its
strength.

For ridge regression the penalty is

$$
P(\beta) = \sum_j \beta_j^2,
$$

which shrinks coefficients smoothly toward zero but never sets them
exactly to zero. For lasso regression the penalty is

$$
P(\beta) = \sum_j |\beta_j|.
$$

Because the absolute value has a sharp corner at zero, lasso can shrink
some coefficients exactly to zero. This property allows lasso to perform
variable selection and estimation in a single step, producing sparse
models in which unimportant predictors are excluded automatically.
Elastic net combines both types of penalties.

### Algorithms

Ridge regression has a closed-form solution obtained by modifying the
normal equations. Lasso and elastic net require iterative algorithms,
with coordinate descent being the most widely used. In practice, these
algorithms are efficient and scale well to high-dimensional data.

When using scikit-learn, predictors must be numeric. Since the Ames data
include categorical variables such as `KitchenQual`, we need to encode
them. We use a `OneHotEncoder` inside a `ColumnTransformer`. This
transforms categorical variables into binary indicator columns while
keeping numeric variables unchanged. The `drop="first"` option avoids
perfect collinearity by omitting one reference category.

```{python}
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, Lasso
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

numeric_features = [
    "OverallQual", "GrLivArea", "GarageCars",
    "TotalBsmtSF", "YearBuilt", "FullBath"
]
categorical_features = ["KitchenQual"]

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ("num", StandardScaler(), numeric_features),
        ("cat", OneHotEncoder(drop="first"), categorical_features)
    ]
)

X = df[numeric_features + categorical_features]
y = df["LogPrice"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42
)

ridge = Pipeline(steps=[
    ("preprocessor", preprocessor),
    ("model", Ridge(alpha=10))
]).fit(X_train, y_train)

lasso = Pipeline(steps=[
    ("preprocessor", preprocessor),
    ("model", Lasso(alpha=0.1))
]).fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Solution Paths

As the penalty parameter $\lambda$ decreases, the behavior of
coefficients changes. Ridge coefficients approach ordinary least squares
estimates, while lasso coefficients enter the model sequentially,
illustrating variable selection.

Because predictors must be on the same scale for a fair comparison, it
is important to standardize the numeric variables before computing the
lasso path. Without standardization, some coefficients can appear flat
or dominate others due to differences in scale.

In our Ames example, we have six numeric predictors and three dummy
variables for `KitchenQual` (since one category was dropped). This means
we are estimating nine coefficients in total, excluding the intercept.
All nine should appear in the solution path once variables are properly
scaled.

```{python}
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import lasso_path
import numpy as np

# Standardized predictors
X_proc = preprocessor.fit_transform(X_train)
scaler = StandardScaler(with_mean=False)
X_proc_std = scaler.fit_transform(X_proc)

# Compute lambda_max
n_samples = X_proc_std.shape[0]
lambda_max = np.max(np.abs(X_proc_std.T @ y_train)) / n_samples

# Define a grid of lambda values
alphas = np.logspace(np.log10(lambda_max), -3, 50)

# Compute solution path
alphas, coefs, _ = lasso_path(X_proc_std, y_train, alphas=alphas)

plt.plot(alphas, coefs.T)
plt.xscale("log")
plt.xlabel("Lambda")
plt.ylabel("Coefficients")
plt.title("Lasso solution paths starting at lambda_max")
plt.show()
```

This plot reveals how each coefficient evolves as $\lambda$ changes. At
large values of $\lambda$, coefficients are shrunk close to zero. As
$\lambda$ decreases, more predictors enter the model. The intercept is
not included in the path and should be ignored when interpreting these
curves.

### Tuning Parameter Selection

Choosing $\lambda$ is critical. Too large, and the model is oversmoothed;
too small, and the penalty has little effect. This parameter controls the
trade-off between model fit and complexity:

- When $\lambda = 0$, the model reduces to the unpenalized regression.
- As $\lambda \to \infty$, coefficients shrink toward zero, increasing bias
  but reducing variance.
  
Choosing $\lambda$ appropriately is crucial. A general principle is to define
a selection criterion $C(\lambda)$, which measures the predictive or
explanatory performance of the fitted model, and then select
$\hat{\lambda} = \arg\min_{\lambda} C(\lambda)$.


Common criteria:

- $R^2$ on a validation set: select $\lambda$ that maximizes
  explained variance.
- Information criteria (AIC, BIC): less common in practice for
  penalized regression.
- Cross-validation (CV): partition data, fit on training folds,
  evaluate on holdout fold, average prediction error across folds.
  

The grid of candidate values is not arbitrary:

- Maximum value:

  $$
  \lambda_{\max} = \max_j \tfrac{1}{n} |x_j^\top y|,
  $$

  with standardized predictors. At this level, all coefficients are zero.
- Minimum value:
  $$
  \lambda_{\min} = \epsilon \cdot \lambda_{\max},
  $$
  with $\epsilon = 10^{-3}$ if $n > p$ and $\epsilon = 10^{-2}$ otherwise.
- Grid: values are log-spaced between $\lambda_{\max}$ and
  $\lambda_{\min}$ (default 100 points in `scikit-learn`).


In the Ames example, we can use $k$-fold cross-validation to evaluate
ridge and lasso models.

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

# Lasso with 10-fold CV
lasso_cv = LassoCV(
    cv=KFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=123),
    random_state=123
)

# Pipeline with preprocessing + model
pipe = Pipeline(steps=[
    ("preprocessor", preprocessor),
    ("model", lasso_cv)
])

pipe.fit(X, y)

# Selected lambda
best_lambda = pipe.named_steps["model"].alpha_
print("Best lambda (alpha) selected by CV:", best_lambda)
```

This process identifies the tuning parameter that balances bias and
variance most effectively, yielding a model that generalizes well beyond
the training data.


## Generalized Linear Models

### Introduction

Linear regression is a powerful tool for continuous outcomes under
Gaussian assumptions, but many response variables encountered in
practice are not continuous or normally distributed. For example, an
indicator of whether a house sale price is above the median is binary,
the number of bathrooms is a count, and proportions such as the fraction
of remodeled homes lie between 0 and 1. Using linear regression in these
settings can yield nonsensical predictions (e.g., negative counts or
probabilities outside the unit interval).


Generalized linear models (GLMs) extend linear regression to cover a
wider range of outcomes. The key idea is to preserve the familiar linear
predictor structure, while linking it to the mean of the outcome through
a function that reflects the nature of the data. The formal framework
was introduced by @nelder1972generalized and remains central in
modern statistics. Today, GLMs are viewed more flexibly: the
distributional assumption provides a convenient likelihood-based loss
function, but in practice one can proceed with quasi-likelihood or even
direct loss minimization without strict distributional commitment.

### Framework

GLMs extend linear regression by introducing a **link function** between
the linear predictor and the conditional mean of the response. In linear
regression we write

$$
Y_i = X_i^\top \beta + \varepsilon_i
$$

with mean zero error $\varepsilon_i$'s.


The mean is simply $\mu_i = X_i^\top \beta$. In a GLM, we
allow non-Gaussian outcomes by defining

$$
\eta_i = X_i^\top \beta, \quad g(\mu_i) = \eta_i,
$$

where $g(\cdot)$ is a monotone link function, $\mu_i = \mathbb{E}(Y_i)$,
and $\beta$ are regression coefficients. The coefficients maintain
the same interpretation as in linear regression: a one-unit change in a
predictor shifts the linear predictor $\eta_i$ by its coefficient, with
an indirect effect on $\mu_i$ through the link.


The variance of $Y_i$ depends on the mean: $\text{Var}(Y_i) = V(\mu_i)
\cdot \phi$, where $V(\cdot)$ is the variance function and $\phi$ is a
dispersion parameter. This structure arises naturally from the
exponential family, which provides a unifying framework for GLMs. While
exact distributional assumptions can be specified, the mean–variance
relationship is often sufficient.

### Special Cases

- **Logistic regression**

  For binary outcomes,

  $$
  Y_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\mu_i), \qquad g(\mu_i) = \log \frac{\mu_i}{1-\mu_i}.
  $$

  The coefficient $\beta_j$ quantifies the log-odds change of success for a
  one-unit increase in $x_{ij}$, with other covariates held fixed.

- **Poisson regression**

  For count data,

  $$
  Y_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\mu_i), \qquad g(\mu_i) = \log(\mu_i).
  $$

  The coefficient $\beta_j$ is interpreted as the log rate ratio, where
  $\exp(\beta_j)$ gives the multiplicative change in expected count for a
  one-unit increase in $x_{ij}$.

- **Gaussian regression**

  For continuous responses,

  $$
  Y_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2), \qquad g(\mu_i) = \mu_i.
  $$

  The coefficient $\beta_j$ represents the expected change in the response
  for a one-unit increase in $x_{ij}$.


Thus, GLMs preserve the linear predictor while flexibly adapting the
link and variance structure to suit binary, count, and continuous data.

### Fitting and Diagnosis

Estimation in generalized linear models is typically carried out by
maximum likelihood. The parameters $\beta$ are obtained by solving
the score equations, which in practice are computed through numerical
optimization. A common algorithm is iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS), which updates coefficient estimates using weighted
least squares until convergence. In Python, functions such as
`statsmodels.api.GLM` or `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`
implement this estimation automatically, providing coefficient estimates
along with standard errors and confidence intervals when applicable.


After fitting a GLM, model adequacy should be checked through
diagnostics. Residuals such as deviance residuals or Pearson residuals
can reveal lack of fit and highlight influential observations. Goodness
of fit can also be assessed with deviance statistics, likelihood ratio
tests, or pseudo-$R^2$ measures. In Python, `statsmodels` provides
methods like `.resid_deviance`, `.resid_pearson`, and influence
statistics to assess model fit. Visual inspection through residual plots
remains a practical tool to detect systematic deviations from model
assumptions.

### Regularized GLM

Regularization extends generalized linear models by adding a penalty to
the log-likelihood, which stabilizes estimation in high-dimensional
settings and enables variable selection. The optimization problem can be
formulated as

$$
\hat{\beta} = \arg\min_{\beta} \Big\{ -\ell(\beta) +
\lambda P(\beta) \Big\},
$$

where $\ell(\beta)$ is the log-likelihood, $P(\beta)$ is a
penalty function, and $\lambda$ is a tuning parameter controlling the
strength of shrinkage.


Common choices of $P(\beta)$ include: 

- Ridge ($L_2$): $\sum_j \beta_j^2$.
- Lasso ($L_1$): $\sum_j |\beta_j|$.
- Elastic Net: $\alpha \sum_j |\beta_j| + (1-\alpha)\sum_j \beta_j^2$.


The fitting algorithm typically involves coordinate descent or gradient-
based optimization methods, which are efficient for large-scale data and
sparse solutions. For example, the `glmnet` algorithm uses cyclical
coordinate descent with warm starts.


Selection of the tuning parameter $\lambda$ is crucial. A standard
approach is cross-validation, where data are split into folds, the
model is fitted on training folds for a grid of $\lambda$ values, and
performance is evaluated on validation folds. The $\lambda$ yielding the
lowest prediction error is chosen, sometimes with an additional rule to
prefer more parsimonious models (the "one standard error rule").


In Python, `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV` or
`sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNetCV` implement these ideas, providing
automatic cross-validation for regularized GLMs.


The general workflow for fitting a regularized logistic regression model
is:

1. Define predictors and outcome: choose relevant numeric and
   categorical features, and specify the binary response.
1. Preprocess features: standardize numeric predictors with
   `StandardScaler()` and encode categorical predictors with
   `OneHotEncoder()`.
1. Set up the pipeline: combine preprocessing with the logistic
   regression model in a unified workflow.
1. Fit with cross-validation: use `LogisticRegressionCV` with lasso
   (L1) or elastic net penalties. Cross-validation automatically
   selects the tuning parameter $\lambda$.
1. Inspect coefficients: identify which predictors remain with nonzero
   coefficients, interpreting them as important contributors to the
   outcome.
1. Evaluate performance: measure predictive accuracy or AUC (see
   chapter on classification) on a held-out test set to assess
   generalization.
   

This structured process ensures stability, interpretability, and good
predictive performance when fitting regularized logistic models.

### Example: Regularized GLM with Ames Housing Data

We continue with the processed Ames housing dataset (OpenML id 42165)
from earlier in the regression chapter. The task is to predict whether a
home is "expensive" (above the median sale price) using selected
predictors. We fit a logistic regression model with an $L_1$ (lasso)
penalty to enable variable selection.

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionCV
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Binary outcome: 1 if SalePrice > median
median_price = df["SalePrice"].median()
y = (df["SalePrice"] > median_price).astype(int)

# Logistic regression with L1 penalty and cross-validation
logit_lasso_cv = Pipeline(steps=[
    ("preprocessor", preprocessor),
    ("model", LogisticRegressionCV(
         Cs=20, cv=5, penalty="l1", solver="saga",
         scoring="accuracy", max_iter=5000,
         random_state=0
    ))
])

logit_lasso_cv.fit(X, y)

# Extract selected coefficients
model = logit_lasso_cv.named_steps["model"]
feature_names = (
    numeric_features +
    list(logit_lasso_cv.named_steps["preprocessor"]
        .named_transformers_["cat"]
        .get_feature_names_out(categorical_features))
)

print("Selected coefficients (lasso):")
for name, coef in zip(feature_names, model.coef_[0]):
    print(f"{name}: {coef:.4f}")

print("\nBest C (inverse of lambda):", model.C_[0])
```

This example demonstrates how lasso-penalized logistic regression can be
used within the GLM framework. The penalty shrinks coefficients toward
zero, with some set exactly to zero if uninformative, thereby improving
interpretability and predictive stability.


We can evaluate classification performance by computing the confusion
matrix:

```{python}
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay

# Predictions
y_pred = logit_lasso_cv.predict(X)

# Confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y, y_pred)
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm,
display_labels=["Not Expensive", "Expensive"])
disp.plot(cmap="Blues")
```
