# Introduction

Background about your research; touch the three questions to be
addressed in an introduction (why do we care; what have been done;
what's new). 

Cite at least two references. 
Cite a reference in text: @agonafir2022machine did something.
Cite a reference in parenthesis: some interesting work has been done
[@agonafir2022understanding].

# Specific Aims

Formulate your research question; translate your research questions
into statistical/data science questions.

# Data

You should have identified the data needed for your project, instead
of stating that you will try to find some data. Give a description
about your data (source, coverage, key variables, structure, etc.) 
and justify its suitability for your research questions.


# Methods and Research Design

What design or methods will you use? Cite relevant references too if
needed [@agonafir2022machine; @agonafir2022understanding].
Show your thoughts on modeling, visualization, analysis,
prediction, validation, or other methodological issues you need
address in order to answer your scientific questions.

# Discussion

What are the most challenge parts of the task? What are the
limitations of your work? What is your fall-back plan if something
unexpected happens?
