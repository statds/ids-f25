This cooperative approach to education was\nfacilitated through the use of GitHub, a platform that encourages\ncollaborative coding and content development. To view\nthese contributions and the lecture notes in their entirety, please\nvisit our GitHub repository at <https://github.com/statds/ids-f25>.\n\n\nStudents contributed to the lecture notes by submitting pull requests\nto our GitHub repository. This method not only enriched the\ncourse material but also provided students with practical experience\nin collaborative software development and version control. \n\n\nFor those interested, class notes from\n[Spring 2025](https://statds.github.io/ids-s25),\n[Fall 2024](https://statds.github.io/ids-f24),\n[Spring 2024](https://statds.github.io/ids-s24),\n[Spring 2023](https://statds.github.io/ids-s23), and\n[Spring 2022](https://statds.github.io/ids-s22/)\nare also publicly accessible. These archives offer\ninsights into the evolution of the course content and the\ndifferent perspectives brought by successive student cohorts.\n\n\n## Compiling the Classnotes\nTo reproduce the classnotes output on your own computer, here are the\nnecessary steps. See Section @sec-buildnotes for details. \n\n+ Clone the classnotes repository to an appropriate location on your\n  computer; see Chapter @sec-git for using Git.\n+ Set up a Python virtual environment in the root folder of the\n  source; see Section @sec-python-venv.\n+ Activate your virtual environment.\n+ Install all the packages specified in `requirements.txt` in your\n  virtual environment:\n ```\n pip install -r requirements.txt\n ```\n+ For some chapters that need to interact with certain sites that\n  require account information. For example, for Google map services,\n  you need to save your API key in a file named `api_key.txt` in the\n  root folder of the source.\n+ Render the book with `quarto render` from the root folder on a\n  terminal; the rendered book will be stored under `_book`.\n\n\n## Midterm Project\n\nReproduce NYC street flood research [@agonafir2022machine;\n@agonafir2022understanding].\n\n\nFour students will be selected to present their work in a workshop at\nthe [2025 NYC Open Data Week](https://2025.open-data.nyc). You are\nwelcome to invite your family and friends to join the workshop.\n\n\n## Final Project\n\nStudents are encouraged to start designing their final projects from\nthe beginning of the semester. There are many open data that can be\nused. Here is a list of useful data challenges:\n\n+ [ASA Data Challenge\n  Expo](https://community.amstat.org/dataexpo/home): big data in 2025\n+ [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).\n+ [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org).\n+ [15 Data Science Hackathons to Test Your Skills in 2025](https://www.fynd.academy/blog/data-science-hackathons)\n+ If you work on sports analytics, you are welcome to submit a\nposter to [Connecticut Sports Analytics Symposium\n(CSAS) 2026](https://statds.org/events/csas2026/).\n+ A good resource for sports analytics is [ScoreNetwork](https://scorenetwork.org).\n+ [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/#/).\n\n## Adapting to Rapid Skill Acquisition\n\nIn this course, students are expected to rapidly acquire new skills, a\ncritical aspect of data science. To emphasize this, consider this\ninsightful quote from @vanderplas2016python:\n\n> When a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member,\n> or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it's less a matter of\n> knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown\n> answer. In data science it's the same: searchable web resources such as online\n> documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a\n> wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you've found\n> yourself searching before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is\n> less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible\n> situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you\n> don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means.\n\nThis quote captures the essence of what we aim to develop in our\nstudents: the ability to swiftly navigate and utilize the vast\nresources available to solve complex problems in data science.\nExamples tasks are: install needed software (or even hardware);\nsearch and find solutions to encountered problems. \n\n## Wishlist\n\nThis is a wish list from all members of the class (alphabetical\norder, last name first, comma, then first name). Here is an example.\n\n\n+ Yan, Jun\n    - Make practical data science tools accessible to undergraduates.\n    - Pass real-world data science project experience to students.\n    - Co-develop a Quarto book in collaboration with the students.\n    - Train students to participate in real data science competitions.\n\n\nAdd yours through a pull request; note the syntax of nested list in\nMarkdown. \n\n\n### Students in 3255\n+ Agostino, Michael Angelo\n    - This is a test\n    - This is a second\n+ Blake, Roger Cooley\n+ Bone, Dylan Jason\n+ Cao, Enshuo\n+ Chen, Irene\n+ Chen, Jingang Calvin\n+ Fazzina, Sophia Carmen\n+ Fu, Wenwei\n+ Haerter, Alejandro Erik\n+ Lawrence, Claire Elise\n+ Levine, Hannah Maya\n+ Lucey, Sonia Niamh\n+ Mayer-Costa, Jaden Paulo\n+ Milun, Lewis Aaron\n+ Montalvo, Victor Samuel\n+ Patel, Sahil Sanjay\n+ Patel, Tulsi Manankumar\n+ Perkins, Jack Thomas\n+ Saltus, Quinn Lloyd Turner\n+ Saxena, Aanya\n+ Schlessel, Jacob E\n+ Sgro, Owen Bentley\n+ Tang, Wilson Chen\n+ Tran, Justin\n+ White, Abigail Lynn\n+ Wishneski, Emma Irene\n+ Yoon, Jessica Nari\n+ Zhang, Mark Justin\n\n### Students in 5255\n+ Anzalone, Matthew James\n+ Gomez-Haibach, Konrad\n+ Hu, Youshuang\n+ Plotnikov, Alexander\n\n\n## Course Logistics\n### Presentation Orders\n\nThe topic presentation order is set up in class.\n\n::: {#89513da6 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nwith open('rosters/3255.txt', 'r') as file:\n    ug = [line.strip() for line in file]\nwith open('rosters/5255.txt', 'r') as file:\n    gr = [line.strip() for line in file]\npresenters = ug + gr\n\nimport random\n## seed jointly set by the class\nrandom.seed(6895 + 283 + 3184 + 3078 + 5901 + 36)\nrandom.sample(presenters, len(presenters))\n## random.shuffle(presenters) # This would shuffle the list in place\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n['Schlessel,Jacob E',\n 'Fazzina,Sophia Carmen',\n 'Blake,Roger Cooley',\n 'Lawrence,Claire Elise',\n 'Agostino,Michael Angelo',\n 'Chen,Jingang Calvin',\n 'Tang,Wilson Chen',\n 'Yoon,Jessica Nari',\n 'Perkins,Jack Thomas',\n 'Fu,Wenwei',\n 'Zhang,Mark Justin',\n 'Patel,Tulsi Manankumar',\n 'Tran,Justin',\n 'Chen,Irene',\n 'Sgro,Owen Bentley',\n 'Plotnikov,Alexander',\n 'Hu,Youshuang',\n 'Cao,Enshuo',\n 'Milun,Lewis Aaron',\n 'Mayer-Costa,Jaden Paulo',\n 'Haerter,Alejandro Erik',\n 'Wishneski,Emma Irene',\n 'Anzalone,Matthew James',\n 'Saltus,Quinn Lloyd Turner',\n 'Montalvo,Victor Samuel',\n 'Bone,Dylan Jason',\n 'Gomez-Haibach,Konrad',\n 'Lucey,Sonia Niamh',\n 'White,Abigail Lynn',\n 'Patel,Sahil Sanjay',\n 'Levine,Hannah Maya',\n 'Saxena,Aanya']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSwitching slots is allowed as long as you find someone who\nis willing to switch with you.

An [introduction on how to use Quarto to prepare\npresentation slides](https://github.com/statds/ids-f24/blob/main/templates/presentation.qmd)\nis available under the `templates` directory in\nthe classnotes source tree, thank to Zachary Blanchard, which can\nbe used as a template to start with.\n\n   Date  | Presenter\n  ------ | ---------------------- \n   04/21 | Shiyi Li; Joann Jun; Ammar Alsadadi; Lang Lang\n   04/23 | John Ackerman; Alyssa Horn; Peiwen Xu; Thomas Schittina\n   04/28 | Daniel Kline; Luke Roy; Xavier Fables; Shubhan Tamhane\n   04/30 | Ruth Nasejje; Vladislav Lagutin; Ethan Long; Amer El Zein\n   05/05 (10:30-12:30)  | Sebastian Symula; Mario Tomiano; Kyle Reed; Yifei Chen; Selena Lin; Nick Pfeifer\n\n### Contributing to the Class Notes\n\nContribution to the class notes is through a `pull request'.\n\n+ Start a new branch and switch to the new branch.\n+ On the new branch, add a `qmd` file for your presentation\n+ If using Python, create and activate a virtual environment with `requirements.txt` \n+ Edit `_quarto.yml` add a line for your `qmd` file to include it in the notes.\n+ Work on your qmd file, test with `quarto render`.\n+ When satisfied, commit and make a pull request with your quarto files and an updated `requirements.txt`.\n\nI have added a template file `mysection.qmd` and a new line to `_quarto.yml`\nas an example.\n\nFor more detailed style guidance, please see my notes on [statistical\nwriting](https://statds.github.io/stat-writing/using-the-right-tools-for-writing.html#latex-for-typesetting).\n\n\nPlagiarism is to be prevented. Remember that these class notes are publicly\navailable online with your names attached.  Here are some resources on [how to\navoid plagiarism](https://usingsources.fas.harvard.edu/how-avoid-plagiarism). \nIn particular, in our course, one convenient way to avoid plagiarism is to use\nour own data (e.g., NYC Open Data). Combined with your own explanation of the\ncode chunks, it would be hard to plagiarize.\n\n\n### Homework Logistics\n\n\n#### Workflow of Submitting Homework Assisngment\n\n+ Click the GitHub classroom assignment link in HuskCT announcement.\n+ Accept the assignment and follow the instructions to an empty\n  repository.\n+ Make a clone of the repo at an appropriate folder on your own\n  computer with `git clone`.\n+ Go to this folder, add your qmd source, work on it, and group your\n  changes to different commits.\n+ Push your work to your GitHub repo with `git push`.\n+ Create a new release and put the generated pdf file in it for ease\n  of grading.\n\n\n#### Requirements\n+ Use the repo from Git Classroom to submit your work. See Chapter @sec-git.\n    - Keep the repo clean (no tracking generated files).\n        - Never \"Upload\" your files; use the git command lines.\n        - Make commit message informative (think about the readers).\n    - Make at least 10 commits and form a style of frequent small commits.\n+ Track `quarto` sources only in your repo. See Chapter @sec-quarto.\n+ For the convenience of grading, add your standalone html or pdf\n  output to a release in your repo.\n+ For standalone pdf output, you will need to have\n  [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) installed.\n\n### Quizzes about Syllabus\n\n+ Do I accept late homework?\n+ Could you list a few examples of email etiquette?\n+ How would you lose style points?\n+ Would you use CLI and GUI?\n<!-- + How many students will present at 2025 NYC ODW and when will the -->\n<!--   presentations be? -->\n+ What's the first date on which you have to complete something about\n  your final project?\n+ Can you use AI for any task in this course? \n+ If you need a reference letter, how could you help me to help you?\n\n## Practical Tips\n\n### Data analysis\n\n+ Use an IDE so you can play with the data interactively\n+ Collect codes that have tested out into a script for batch processing\n+ During data cleaning, keep in mind how each variable will be used later\n+ No keeping large data files in a repo; assume a reasonable location with your collaborators\n\n### Presentation\n\n+ Don't forget to introduce yourself if there is no moderator.\n+ Highlight your research questions and results, not code.\n+ Give an outline, carry it out, and summarize.\n+ Use your own examples to reduce the risk of plagiarism.\n\n\n<!-- Topic presentation template -->\n## My Presentation Topic (Template)\n\nThis section was prepared by John Smith.\n\nUse Markdown syntax. If not clear on what to do, learn from the class\nnotes sources.\n\n+ Pay attention to the sectioning levels.\n+ Cite references with their bib key.\n+ In examples, maximize usage of data set that the class is familiar with.\n+ Could use datasets in Python packages or downloadable on the fly.\n+ Test your section by `quarto render <filename.qmd>`.\n\n\n### Introduction\n\nHere is an overview.\n\n\n### Sub Topic 1\n\nPut materials on topic 1 here\n\nPython examples can be put into `python` code chunks:\n\n::: {#9d932c42 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# import pandas as pd\n\n# do something\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Sub Topic 2\n\nPut materials on topic 2 here.\n\n### Sub Topic 3\n\nPut matreials on topic 3 here.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nPut sumaries here.\n\n### Further Readings\n\nPut links to further materials.\n\n",
