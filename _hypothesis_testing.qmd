## Hypothesis Testing with 'scipy.stats' 

This section was prepared by Jessica Yoon, an undergraduate senior pursuing a
degree in Biological Data Science 

### What is Hypothesis Testing?

- **Hypothesis testing** is a statistical method used to make decisions or
draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.  
- It helps determine whether results we observe are due to **chance** or 
reflect a **real effect**.  
- Every test starts with two statements:  
  - **Null hypothesis (H₀):** No effect, no difference, or no relationship.  
  - **Alternative hypothesis (H₁):** There *is* an effect, difference, or relationship.  

### Why Hypothesis Testing is Important

- Provides a **structured, objective framework** for decision-making under uncertainty.  
- Separates **signal from noise** — prevents drawing conclusions based on intuition alone.  
- Commonly used to:  
  - Compare **treatments or interventions** (e.g., drug vs placebo)  
  - Evaluate **policy changes** (e.g., new traffic laws on crash rates)  
  - Detect **patterns or associations** (e.g., weather vs accident frequency)  

### The Logic Behind It

1. Collect sample data from a population.  
2. Compute a **test statistic** to measure how far our data deviate from H₀.  
3. Use a **probability distribution** (t, F, or chi-square) to find a **p-value**.  
4. The **p-value** tells us how likely our observed data would occur if H₀ were true.  
5. Decision rule:  
   - If *p* < α (usually 0.05): reject H₀ → evidence of an effect.  
   - If *p* ≥ α: fail to reject H₀ → no strong evidence against H₀.

### Example Context: Ames Housing Dataset 

- The Ames Housing dataset lets us explore real housing market patterns in Ames, Iowa, 
  and examine how different property features relate to sale price.  
  - Are sale prices different across **neighborhoods** (ex: high-end vs more affordable areas)?  
  - Do certain features, such as **central air**, a **garage**, or a **larger living area 
    (GrLivArea)**, tend to be associated with higher sale prices?  
  - Is there a relationship between variables like **overall quality (OverallQual)** or 
    **lot area** and the final **SalePrice**?  
- Hypothesis testing provides **quantitative evidence** for these questions — helping us decide 
    which features are truly associated with higher (or lower) prices in Ames, rather than just 
    relying on intuition or assumptions.  

### Load, Clean and Preview the Data 

- Let's begin by loading the data. 

```{python}
# Step 1: import essential packages for analysis and visualization 
import pandas as pd # used for data manipulation and structuring data in a DataFrame 
import numpy as np # supports numerical operations
from scipy import stats # provides statistical operations 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # visualizations
import seaborn as sns # visualizations 

# Step 2: Load dataset from csv 
ames = pd.read_csv("data/AmesHousing.csv")
```

- Then, we want to clean the data 
- Missing or null data (NaNs) can cause statistical test to fail or 
return NaN results, especially with scipy.stats
- Cleaning ensures the tests use valid and complete data 

```{python}
# Step 1: Clean up column names
ames.columns = (
    ames.columns
        .str.strip()                     # remove leading/trailing spaces
        .str.lower()                     # convert to lowercase
        .str.replace(' ', '_')           # replace spaces with underscores
        .str.replace('[^a-z0-9_]', '', regex=True)  # remove special characters
)

# Step 2: Drop columns that are completely empty (all NaN)
ames = ames.dropna(axis=1, how='all')

# Step 3: Focus on key variables and drop rows with missing values in those
cols_of_interest = ['saleprice', 'neighborhood', 'grlivarea',
                    'overallqual', 'centralair']

ames_clean = ames.dropna(subset=cols_of_interest)

# Step 4: Verify the cleaned dataset
ames_clean.info()
ames_clean.head()
```

- We can summarize the dataset using '.describe()' to see its spread and variability before running tests

```{python}
housing.describe()
```

### One-Sample T-test 

- A one-sample t-test is a statistical test used to determine whether the mean of 
a single sample is significantly different from a known or hypothesized population mean.
- In the context of housing data, we can test whether the average house price differs 
from a target or benchmark value. For example, $1 million. 
- H₀: μ = 1,000,000 (average house price = 1)
- H₁: μ ≠ 1,000,000 (average house price ≠ 1) 

```{python}
prices = housing["medv"].dropna()

t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(prices, popmean=20)  
t_stat, p_value
```

- The t_stat tells us how far the sample mean is from the hypothesized value
- The p_value tells us how unusual that different would be if H₀ were true
- the ttest_1samp() compares sample's mean to a known population mean 

```{python}
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print(f"Reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.3f}) → Mean home value differs significantly from $20,000.")
else:
    print(f"Fail to reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.3f}) → No significant difference from $20,000.")
```

- The output (6.19, 1.21e-09) corresponds to the t-statistic and p-value 
- The t-statistic means that the sample is roughly 6 standard errors away from the 
hypothesized population mean of $20,000 
- The p-value is extremely small, far below the 0.05 significance threshold
- We can conclude that the mean home value is significantly different from $20,000 and 
we reject the null hypothesis. The average housing prices are not centered around $20,000 

- We can also visualize this by using a histogram

```{python}
plt.hist(prices, bins=30, color="skyblue", edgecolor="black")
plt.axvline(20, color="red", linestyle="--", label="μ = 20 ($20,000)")
plt.title("Distribution of Median Home Values")
plt.xlabel("Median Value ($1000s)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

- Notice how most homes cluster below the hypothesized mean value, shown by the red dashed 
line at μ = 20 (\$20,000).
- Most home fall to the left of this line, showing that the actual mean is significantly 
higher than $20,000, which is consistent with the t-test result 

- If the data were not normally distributed, meaning the data was skewed or had outliers, 
we'd use the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test instead.
- The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test compares the median of the sample to a hypothesized value. 
- H₀: median home value = $20,000 
- H₁: median home value ≠ $20,000

```{python}
from scipy.stats import wilcoxon

prices = housing["medv"].dropna()

wilcoxon(prices - 20, alternative="two-sided")
```

```{python}
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print(f"Reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → Median home value differs significantly from $20,000.")
else:
    print(f"Fail to reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → No significant difference from $20,000.")
```

- wilcoxon() tests whether the median of the sample differs from a hypothesized value 
- alternative="twosided" checks for any difference 
- Wilcoxon test statistic = 48,214.5 and p <0.001
- We would reject the null hypothesis and conclude the median home value is significantly higher 
than $20,000, confiming the t-test results without assuming normality

### Two Sample T-Test 

- A two-sample t-test (also called an independent samples t-test) is used to compare 
the means of two independent groups to see if they’re statistically different from 
each other.
- Here, we’ll test whether the average home value differs between houses located 
along the Charles River and those not near the river.
- H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ (the mean home values are the same for houses near and away from the 
Charles River.)
- H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂ (the mean home values differ depending on proximity to the Charles River.)

```{python}
from scipy import stats

by_river = housing[housing["chas"] == 1]["medv"].dropna()
not_by_river = housing[housing["chas"] == 0]["medv"].dropna()

t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(by_river, not_by_river, equal_var=False)
print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat:.3f}, P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

```{python}
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print(f"Reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → Mean home values differ significantly based on proximity to the Charles River.")
else:
    print(f"Fail to reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → No significant difference in mean home values based on proximity to the Charles River.")
```

- chas is a binary variable (1 = near river and 0 = away)
- ttest_ind() compares means of two independent groups 
- equal_var=False: Welch's t-test version, which doesn't assume equal variances
- t = 3.11, p = 0.0036 
- We would reject the null hypothesis so we can conclude that homes near the Charles River 
have significantly different mean values than those farther away 

- We can visualize these differences using boxplots 
- The boxes represent interquartile ranges, so if they barely overlap that's a visual 
clue of statisticla difference 

```{python}
sns.boxplot(x="chas", y="medv", data=housing, palette="pastel")
plt.title("Median Home Values – Near vs. Away from Charles River")
plt.xlabel("Next to Charles River (1 = Yes, 0 = No)")
plt.ylabel("Median Home Value ($1000s)")
plt.show()
```

- This boxplot compares the median home values for houses next to the Charles River 
(chas =1 ) versus those not near the river (chas = 0) 
- The orange box is visibly higher than the blue box, showing that homes near the 
Charles river tend to have high median values 

- If the data don't meet the t-test assumptions (normality, equal variance), 
we use the Mann-Whitney U test between two groups 
- In this case, we will test whether the distributions of median home values 
differ for houses near versus away from the Charles River
- H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ (the distributions of home values are the same for both groups.) 
- H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂ (the distributions of home values differ between the two groups.) 

```{python}
from scipy import stats

by_river = housing[housing["chas"] == 1]["medv"].dropna()
not_by_river = housing[housing["chas"] == 0]["medv"].dropna()

stat, p_value = stats.mannwhitneyu(by_river, not_by_river, alternative="two-sided")

print(f"Mann-Whitney U statistic: {stat:.3f}, p-value: {p_value:.4f}")

alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print(f"Reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → "
          f"Median home values differ significantly based on proximity to the Charles River.")
else:
    print(f"Fail to reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → "
          f"No significant difference in median home values based on proximity to the Charles River.")
```

### ANOVA 

- ANOVA stands for Analysis of Variance
- It’s a statistical method used to compare the means of three or more groups to 
determine whether at least one of them is significantly different from the others.
- Here, we’ll compare the average home values (medv) across different levels of
highway accessibility (rad).
- H₀: All group means are equal.
- H₁: At least one group mean differs.

```{python}
from scipy import stats
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

groups = [group["medv"].dropna() for name, group in housing.groupby("rad")]

f_stat, p_value = stats.f_oneway(*groups)

print(f"F-statistic: {f_stat:.3f}, P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print(f"Reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → "
          f"Mean home values differ significantly across highway accessibility levels.")
else:
    print(f"Fail to reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → "
          f"No significant difference in mean home values across highway accessibility levels.")

```

- groupby("rad") splits data into groups based on accessibility index 
- f_oneway() performs the one-way ANOVA test 

- To see this visually: 

```{python}
sns.boxplot(x="rad", y="medv", data=housing, palette="pastel")
plt.title("Home Values Across Highway Accessibility Levels (RAD)")
plt.xlabel("RAD (Accessibility to Highways)")
plt.ylabel("Median Home Value ($1000s)")
plt.show()
```


- The Kruskal–Wallis test is a nonparametric alternative to one-way ANOVA.
- It’s used when the normality assumption is violated or the data contain 
outliers.
- Here, we compare median home values (medv) across different levels of highway 
accessibility (rad).
- H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ = μ₃ = … (the distributions of home values are the same across all 
highway accessibility levels)
- H₁: At least one μᵢ differs (the distributions of home values differ across 
highway accessibility levels) 

```{python}
groups = [group["medv"].dropna() for name, group in housing.groupby("rad")]

h_stat, p_value = stats.kruskal(*groups)

print(f"H-statistic: {h_stat:.3f}, P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print(f"Reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → "
          f"Median home values differ significantly across highway accessibility levels.")
else:
    print(f"Fail to reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → "
          f"No significant difference in median home values across highway accessibility levels.")
```

### Chi-Square Test of Independence 

- The Chi-Square Test of Independence checks whether two categorical variables 
are related or independent of each other.
- It’s a nonparametric test, meaning it doesn’t assume normality or equal variances.
- Here, we test whether proximity to the Charles River (chas) is related to 
highway accessibility (rad).
- H₀: chas and rad are independent.
- H₁: There is an association between chas and rad.

```{python}
table = pd.crosstab(housing["chas"], housing["rad"])

chi2, p_value, dof, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(table)

print(f"Chi2 Statistic: {chi2:.3f}, P-value: {p_value:.4f}, Degrees of Freedom: {dof}")

alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print(f"Reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → There is a significant association "
          f"between proximity to the Charles River and highway accessibility.")
else:
    print(f"Fail to reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → No significant association "
          f"between proximity to the Charles River and highway accessibility.")
```

- pd.crosstab() creates a contingency table 
- chi2_contingency() tests independence of two categorical variables 

- Visual

```{python}
sns.countplot(x="rad", hue="chas", data=housing, palette="pastel")

plt.title("Highway Accessibility by Proximity to the Charles River")
plt.xlabel("RAD (Index of Highway Accessibility)")
plt.ylabel("Count of Homes")
plt.legend(title="Next to Charles River (1 = Yes, 0 = No)")
plt.show()
```

- Chi-square tests are great for frequency data, think of them as testing whether 
"categories are distributed as expected"

### Proportion Test  

- A proportion test is used to compare observed proportions to a 
hypothesized proportion or between two groups.
- Useful for categorical yes/no variables, like homes located next 
to the Charles River (`chas`).
- H₀: p = p₀ (the true proportion equals the hypothesized value)
- H₁: p ≠ p₀ (the true proportion differs from the hypothesized value)

```{python}
from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportions_ztest

count = (housing["chas"] == 1).sum()
nobs = len(housing)
p0 = 0.10

stat, p_value = proportions_ztest(count, nobs, value=p0, alternative="two-sided")
print(f"Z-statistic: {stat:.3f}, P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject H₀ → The proportion of homes near the river differs from 10%.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject H₀ → No significant difference from 10%.")
```

- count is the number of homes near the river 
- nobs is the total homes 
- p0 is the hypothesized proportionn 
- proportions_ztest() is the z-test for proportions (like t-test but for percentages) 

### Correlation Test 

- The Correlation Test measures the strength and direction of the relationship 
between two continuous variables.
- r close to +1 means a strong correlation 
- r close to 0 means little or no correlation 
- r close to -1 means a strong negative correlation 
- Here, we test whether there is a linear relationship between the number of rooms 
per dwelling (rm) and the median home value (medv).
- H₀: ρ = 0 (no correlation between rooms and home value._ 
- H₁: ρ ≠ 0 (a significant correlation exists between rooms and home value.) 

```{python}
x = housing["rm"]      # average number of rooms per dwelling
y = housing["medv"]    # median home value ($1000s)

corr, p_value = stats.pearsonr(x, y)

print(f"Correlation coefficient (r): {corr:.3f}, P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print(f"Reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → There is a significant linear correlation between rooms and home value.")
else:
    print(f"Fail to reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → No significant correlation between rooms and home value.")
```

- Scatterplot for visualization 

```{python}
sns.scatterplot(x=housing["rm"], y=housing["medv"], alpha=0.4)
plt.title("Rooms vs. Median Home Value")
plt.xlabel("Average Number of Rooms per Dwelling (RM)")
plt.ylabel("Median Home Value ($1000s)")
plt.show()
```

- The Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ) measures the strength and direction 
of a monotonic relationship between two continuous variables.
- Unlike Pearson’s correlation, it doesn’t assume normality or a linear relationship.
- Here, we test whether the number of rooms (rm) and median home value (medv) are 
monotonically related.
- H₀: ρ = 0 (There is no monotonic relationship between the number of rooms and home value.)
- H₁: ρ ≠ 0 (There is a monotonic relationship between the number of rooms and home value.)

```{python}
x = housing["rm"].fillna(0)
y = housing["medv"].fillna(0)

rho, p_value = stats.spearmanr(x, y)

print(f"Spearman’s rho: {rho:.3f}, P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print(f"Reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → There is a significant monotonic relationship between rooms and home value.")
else:
    print(f"Fail to reject H₀ (p = {p_value:.4f}) → No significant monotonic relationship between rooms and home value.")
```
